Brooke, we're all upset,
but we need to move on.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:46.969
Honey, you're a junior now.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.359
It's your make-or-break year,

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.693
so there's no
room for self-pity.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.393
Can you give Marlene
and I a ride to school today?

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.279
I'm sorry, honey,
I don't have time.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.670
I have an 8:30 with Marc
Shelley at White & Wolfe.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.249
What?! Richard, you
didn't say anything!

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.265
How did you get the meeting?

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.487
It's just a meeting, so
don't get too excited.

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:06.912
But it could be huge.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.345
I know!

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.726
Who's going to the
meeting with you?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.480
Hey, I got the meeting.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.419
I know, I just think maybe you
should take Melinda or Janice.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.420
Janice? You want
me to take Janice?

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.388
- Yeah, why not?
- I'm not taking Janice.

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.051
- Rough morning?
- You know my parents.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.857
Maybe they just
need a little more time.

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:27.093
I don't know about that.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.669
I'd say they're pretty over it.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.399
My mom's making tacos tonight.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.304
I'll let her know you're coming.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.307
It's not like they'll miss me.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.105
Brooke, I'm serious, honey.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.146
You need to get
focused or you could say,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.045
"Good-bye Stanford,
hello Somewhere State."

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.709
Got it.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.087
Yikes.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:52.558
Good morning!

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.957
Morning, Grace.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.214
I keep telling you, you
don't have to keep doing this.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.628
Are you kidding?

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.630
This is the best part
of my day, Gramps.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.758
Pills first.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:05.896
You're a good girl.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.976
Ah, honey, you know I'm not
gonna be around here forever,

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:12.773
and you might wanna start
thinking about some other guy

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:15.974
you wanna have breakfast with.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.812
I'll work on that.

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.182
Okay.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.414
You know, I love the
way you do the oatmeal,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:25.082
but what do you say

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:28.321
I take you out for bacon and
eggs this morning, my treat.

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.828
Not after your last
cholesterol test.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.644
Besides, I have some
papers I have to grade

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.699
before the staff meeting.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.132
I'm 81 years old,

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:38.796
and bacon is not
gonna be what kills me.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:43.001
Nice try, you're 82.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.013
Yeah.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:50.515
Good morning.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.948
Have a nice day.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.350
Morning, ladies.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.784
Morning.

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.119
Good morning.

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.126
Hey, what do you call a
teacher with no students?

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.494
Unemployed.

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:07.692
I got it, how about ecstatic?

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:10.099
You're both right. Retired!

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.365
Only 36 days to go!

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.816
You know you're
gonna miss the kids

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.206
when you're gone, Rizzo.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:17.868
No, Grace. That's
sweet, but no, I won't.

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.411
The older I get,

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.157
the more difficult these
kids are to deal with.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.649
I totally agree.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.026
Yesterday, I just about
snatched at Tim Webster.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.643
That boy had me
on my last nerve.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.996
Well, I happen to think
that difficult students

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.545
can be a blessing.

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:33.388
Grace, honey, when is this
optimism ever gonna wear off?

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.990
Bill. Bill.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.500
Bill.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.567
Junk mail.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.172
Oh, man!

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:52.212
David, why are
you always so sad?

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:55.476
Hey! You're back!

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.914
Why are you back?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.348
My pastor gave me permission

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.215
to finish my
doctorate at Hadleigh,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.554
so if that's okay with you,
I'm gonna be here for awhile.

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.888
Oh, David, you are a mess.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.292
What happened to you?

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.398
I woke up.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.698
Okay, for 500 points,

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.168
for all the cheese,
for the game.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.104
This quote is from
what document?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.970
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.388
"that all men are created equal,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.002
"that they are endowed
by their Creator

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.622
with certain unalienable
rights, that among these..."

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.911
Boom, baby!

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:30.847
All right, Team 1,
what's your answer?

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.217
Our answer is the
Declaration of Independence.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.722
That's... correct!

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.257
Team 1 wins!

00:07:38.358 --> 00:07:40.657
Yes!

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.059
Okay, you guys,

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:45.241
Monday we will examine the
assertion of individual rights

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.597
through the last century.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.033
Have a good weekend.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.803
Brooke, are you okay?

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:58.275
I'm fine.

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:00.176
Are you sure?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.044
Yeah, thanks.

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:20.925
Ms. Ryan?

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.816
I lied.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.270
Are you sure you're being fair?

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.525
Trust me, they're over it,

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:53.064
and they expect
me to be over it, too.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.465
It's like to them, he
never even existed.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.128
The only thing
that I know for sure

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:01.834
is that I'm never going
to see my brother again.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.501
Everybody's asked if there's
anything that they can do.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.272
The truth is, no
one can do anything

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:07.979
because the only
thing that I really want

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:09.549
is 5 more minutes
to tell my brother

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:12.652
how I really felt about him.

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:16.382
Did your brother believe
there was something more?

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:18.389
I don't know.

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:22.895
Do you?

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.840
Brooke, every person
reaches a point in their life

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:26.992
when they ask
themselves this question.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.036
There's nothing wrong
with you asking it, too.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.669
You never let
anything get to you.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.744
How do you do that?

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.077
Jesus.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.333
Hello?

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.735
How'd it go, Amy?

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.536
Michael.

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.805
It's gone.

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.177
My cancer's... it's gone.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.910
Oh, my goodness!

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.542
That's incredible!

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:25.284
I know. I just...
I can't believe it.

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.757
Isn't that what you prayed for?

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:31.422
Yes, of course. I just...

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.433
Prayer is a powerful thing,

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:38.971
and it turns out God has
much bigger plans for you.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.848
You okay, Grace?

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:54.011
Yeah, I just can't stop
thinking about Brooke.

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.850
You know, she's searching.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.480
She's hurting.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:01.493
Yeah, that's the
thing about atheism.

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:06.191
It doesn't take away the pain;
it just takes away the hope.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.267
What'd you tell her?

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:09.734
The truth.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.135
Now she's free to
make her own choice.

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:14.138
Unfortunately, in
this day and age,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.110
people seem to forget that
the most basic human right of all

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:21.511
is a right to know Jesus.

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:23.276
Let's put her on
the prayer list.

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:26.512
Prayer always seems
to be the last thing we do,

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.953
when it should be the first.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.150
Now, how 'bout
some more popcorn?

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:35.558
With a glycemic index
of 100, not a chance.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.973
I swear, Grace, if you
don't start feeding me better,

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:41.832
I'm gonna leave you
for a nursing home.

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.302
Well, that's it for me.

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.532
I'm going to bed.

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:47.936
Love ya.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.669
I love you better.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.835
Love you first.

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:53.276
That's unfair.

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.049
Gotcha!

00:12:01.955 --> 00:12:04.686
Brooke, the people from
that charity place are here

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:06.089
to pick up your
brother's things.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:09.390
Can you make sure
they get everything?

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.158
And don't forget to
put the milk away!

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:41.580
- Well, that's the last of it.
- Thank you.

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:44.055
And, well, I was loading one
of the boxes onto the truck,

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:48.891
I noticed this and I thought
you might wanna keep it.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.226
So sorry for your loss.

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:36.407
And so, peaceful nonviolence

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:38.944
comes first in
India under Gandhi,

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.223
and then later, here in the
United States under Dr. King

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.217
and others as a means
of achieving civil rights.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.445
But what makes
nonviolence so radical

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.455
is its unwavering commitment
to a nonviolent approach,

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.822
not just initially, but in the
face of escalating persecution

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.589
by the opposing force.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:58.895
Yes?

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.591
Isn't that sort of like
what Jesus meant

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:04.263
when he said that we
should love our enemies?

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.273
Yes.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.570
The writer of the
Gospel of Matthew

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.475
records Jesus as saying,
"You have heard it said,

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:16.048
"love your neighbor
and hate your enemy,

00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:19.050
"but I tell you,
love your enemies

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.849
"and pray for those
who persecute you,

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:25.186
that you will be children
of your Father in heaven,"

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:28.420
which indicates a
commitment to nonviolence.

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:29.824
Dr. King confirmed the link,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.761
describing his
inspiration from Scripture,

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:35.562
saying Christ furnished
the spirit and motivation,

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.761
while Gandhi
furnished the method.

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:39.202
Except that that didn't work.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:42.469
Jesus got himself killed
and everybody knows that.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.510
Well, so did Dr. King.

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:50.049
So, I guess it just depends
on how you measure success.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.189
Both men created movements
that survive to this day,

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:54.881
even though both
paid the ultimate price

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.455
for their commitment
to their ideals.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:57.682
I still wouldn't do it.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.520
Well,

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.526
not very many people
have that kind of courage.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.791
But I, for one, am
grateful for those that do,

00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:09.631
you know, those who stand
up for what they believe.

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:17.577
Have a good day.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.648
Are you Pastor Dave?

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.124
I am.

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:37.061
- I'm Martin Yip.
- Nice to meet you.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.291
My friend Josh Wheaton
said you might be able

00:16:39.432 --> 00:16:41.867
to answer my
questions about God.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.028
Well, that definitely falls
within my job description.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:48.971
How many questions have you got?

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:53.603
So far, 147.

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.238
Is something wrong?

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.646
No.

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:58.160
Josh encouraged
me to write them down

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.584
and be as comprehensive
as possible.

00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:01.177
Of course he did.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.131
Well, I'll have to thank
him next time I see him.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.350
Come on.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.730
So, what's your first question?

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:11.528
Grace, I just have
to hear it from you.

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:13.394
Did this happen?

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.933
If you're asking
whether I responded

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.801
to a student's question, yes.

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:21.204
If you're asking whether
her question and my answer

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.832
both referenced Jesus as it
was relevant to the history lesson

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:28.744
we were discussing,
again, I'd have to say yes.

00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.286
Good afternoon, Ms. Wesley.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.420
I've asked Bob
Fessler to sit in,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.188
he's the school's attorney,

00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:47.233
to advise us on any legal issues
we might be brushing up against.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:48.834
Should I have a lawyer, too?

00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:50.733
No, I don't see
the need for that.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.899
Ms. Rizzo is present as
your union representation.

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:57.635
Okay.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.611
We are here to hear
your side of the story.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:06.185
Now, I understand a student in
your second period history class

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:07.685
asked a question
about the parallels

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.313
between the teachings of Gandhi

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:13.825
and remarks allegedly
made by Jesus.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.952
Yes, that's correct.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:20.430
And your answer incorporated
specific detailed reference

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:24.697
to those teachings that
included Scripture itself,

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:28.002
the words of Jesus.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.905
Yes.

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.910
What were you thinking, Grace?

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:35.014
Do you believe your
response was in line

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.140
with district policy?

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.081
Yes.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.529
As well as in compliance

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:44.217
with state and
federal guidelines?

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.087
Yes, sir.

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:51.495
Well, Ms. Wesley,
unfortunately for you,

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:57.093
I'm fairly certain the
school board will disagree.

00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:01.768
No, Coach, you're
not hearing me.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:04.469
No prayers.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.341
No moments of silence. Nothing.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.415
It's tradition on the field.

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:11.814
Not on the field, not
in the locker room,

00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:13.495
not in the parking lot
for that matter, okay?

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.418
Whatever you say.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.647
Okay, thanks, Coach.

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.154
Come on in.

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.587
Hi, Brooke.

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.717
You wanted to see me?

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:24.228
Ms. Wesley is currently
under disciplinary review.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.807
All of her classes
have been reassigned

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.527
until things are settled.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.602
I don't want you to have
any contact with her.

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:32.729
None whatsoever, either
on or off school property.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.636
Do I have any say in this?

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.300
No, I've already discussed
things with your father

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.402
and he agrees.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.482
Since when does my dad care?

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:44.455
Brooke, the important
thing for you to remember

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.494
is you've done nothing wrong.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.611
Neither did Ms. Wesley.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.278
All she did was
answer a question.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.998
Ms. Wesley's answer was
not in line with school policy.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.513
Really?

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:53.468
I mean, aren't we allowed
to say what we believe?

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:54.516
When did that change?

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.356
I'm not gonna argue with you,

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.473
and I don't want you discussing
the situation with anyone.

00:19:58.497 --> 00:19:59.863
Do you understand?

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.925
Do you understand?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.607
Yes.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.051
Grace?

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.488
Are you...

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:28.186
Tom Endler, your
union-appointed attorney.

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:29.785
You don't look like a lawyer.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.488
Thank you.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.463
I'm not sure I meant
that as a compliment.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.057
I'm determined
to take it as one.

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:38.035
Shall we sit?

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.641
So, have you
defended many teachers

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:44.438
in disciplinary matters?

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.170
Nope, you're my first.

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.509
Just hired on from the
public defender's office.

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:50.139
Criminal law?

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.218
No offense, but
I'm not a criminal.

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:53.649
Don't be so sure of that.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.722
Your kind of case makes
everybody uncomfortable.

00:20:55.821 --> 00:20:58.222
School boards,
teachers, parents.

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:01.191
It makes them feel... yucky.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:02.591
Yucky?

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:05.357
Is that a technical legal term?

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:07.456
You got a better word for it?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.035
Grace, I'm gonna level with you.

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:11.695
Nobody wants your case.

00:21:11.804 --> 00:21:14.000
I drew it because I'm
low man on the totem pole

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.972
in a place where
seniority means everything.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.135
If, for whatever reason,
you're not happy with me,

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.974
you're on your own.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.413
You're free to hire your own
attorney out of your own pocket.

00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:27.885
Educational law isn't
exactly a common specialty.

00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:29.979
So, what's the good news?

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:32.023
I don't like to lose.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:35.526
And I'm willing
to fight for you.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.153
Are you a believer?

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.788
You mean a Christian?

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.163
No, but I think
that's an advantage.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.769
Why?

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:45.046
You're passionate
about what you believe.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.663
I mean, let's face it,

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.606
it's why you're in
trouble in the first place.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:53.341
But it blinds you to the
realities of procedure.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.712
Okay.

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:59.115
Okay, what?

00:21:59.218 --> 00:22:01.449
Okay, I agree to let
you represent me.

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:04.547
- Good.
- Good.

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:11.963
David, are you okay?

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.089
Um, terrific.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.261
There was a young
man in here, brilliant kid,

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:21.306
with no exposure to Scripture
until a few months ago.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.774
He came in with some questions.

00:22:24.877 --> 00:22:28.314
147 of 'em to be exact.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:31.940
I feel like I've been hit by
a truck loaded with Bibles.

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:35.351
Big heavy ones with
those thick covers.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:40.124
Always be ready to give
answer as to why you believe

00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:43.458
and the reason for your hope.

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.828
1 Peter chapter 3, verse 15.

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.298
Yes.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.268
And where were you 4 hours ago?

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:55.708
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:59.039
"and lean not on your
own understanding.

00:22:59.178 --> 00:23:01.647
"In all your ways,
acknowledge him

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:05.741
and he will make
your paths straight."

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:19.027
Father, I need you.

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:24.569
I can't do this alone.

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:29.971
I know that you're in control.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:34.672
Please, give me the courage.

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:42.244
In Jesus' name, amen.

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:51.890
Call to order.

00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:55.092
I assume Ms. Wesley understands
that this board has the power

00:23:55.234 --> 00:23:58.227
to recommend any number
of disciplinary actions,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.999
up to and including termination.

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.574
She does.

00:24:02.708 --> 00:24:04.386
And this board should
be aware that in the event

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.038
of such termination,

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:08.307
which we would view as both
wrongful and without cause,

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:09.938
she reserves all
rights of redress.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.381
I may have a solution.

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:16.080
There might be a way around
all of this unpleasantness

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.417
that would satisfy all parties.

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:22.426
A disciplinary notice
in Ms. Wesley's file

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:26.965
stating the school board's
objections to her behavior,

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.898
a response from Ms. Wesley

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:32.733
confessing the
inappropriateness of

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:36.297
and apologizing for her actions,

00:24:36.442 --> 00:24:39.139
along with a pledge
not to engage

00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:44.239
in similar discussion
of Jesus in the future.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.328
I'm confident that we can
move forward on that basis.

00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:48.583
No.

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:51.452
Grace...

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:52.855
I can't.

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.755
I'd like to request
a brief recess

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:00.992
to have a word with my client.

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:02.761
Excuse me.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.831
Grace, this is exactly
what we were hoping for.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.918
I mean, this is the part
where you say you're sorry,

00:25:09.942 --> 00:25:11.501
thank your lawyer,

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:15.876
go back to your classroom,
pick up your life, and move on.

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:19.850
- I can't do that.
- Why?

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.476
I gave an honest answer

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.420
to a student's legitimate
question in history.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:24.956
Grace.

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:27.993
Grace, you don't wanna do this.

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:32.690
It's the wrong decision.

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.959
Is it?

00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:38.003
I mean, I would
rather stand with God

00:25:38.137 --> 00:25:40.299
and be judged by the world

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:45.208
than stand with the world
and be judged by God.

00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:51.306
I am not gonna be afraid
to say the name "Jesus."

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.290
I know her. She's
not gonna go for it.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.639
How do we make this go away

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:06.825
and not get blood on our hands?

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.901
That's the easy part.

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:11.333
We let the ACLU do it.

00:26:11.437 --> 00:26:14.134
They'll file suit
against Ms. Wesley

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:17.937
and if she is found
liable, which she will be,

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:19.875
then we fire her for cause.

00:26:20.012 --> 00:26:21.852
But the school district
will certainly be named

00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:23.576
as a codefendant.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.116
We don't have the financial
wherewithal to fight that.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.049
They've already been in touch.

00:26:28.187 --> 00:26:30.986
They aren't interested
in punishing the school.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.355
They want her.

00:26:33.459 --> 00:26:34.757
Are you sure?

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.225
Trust me.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:39.957
They've been dreaming
of a case like this.

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:52.372
While Ms. Wesley apologizes
for any inconvenience

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:55.175
her actions may have caused,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.374
Ms. Wesley stands
by her statements,

00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:59.179
and she does not
retract or recant them,

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:05.053
either in full or in part.

00:27:05.157 --> 00:27:07.991
So noted.

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:15.730
Having little choice, this board
recommends continued suspension,

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:18.394
henceforth without pay,

00:27:18.504 --> 00:27:21.064
pending review by a court
of competent jurisdiction

00:27:21.173 --> 00:27:23.267
to determine whether or
not Ms. Wesley violated

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:27.402
local, state, or
federal guidelines.

00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:29.778
This proceeding is adjourned.

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.102
The last thing we need is

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.290
a bunch of religious fanatics

00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:47.924
protesting outside of our house.

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.195
We'll work to keep it
out of the media for now.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:53.066
But next year, when you're
applying to all the colleges,

00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.834
you'll be able to tell the story

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.807
of how Brooke was part of a
landmark constitutional case

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.744
concerning the separation
of church and state.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:04.476
And believe me, there is not
an Ivy League admissions board

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:08.576
that could resist that.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:11.282
And think of the other
children out there,

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.790
innocent children
who are subjected

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.952
to their repressive
belief system.

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:17.927
And not forgetting the
financial opportunities.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.464
Yes.

00:28:19.565 --> 00:28:22.125
Ms. Wesley is an employee
of the school board.

00:28:22.234 --> 00:28:24.362
We win in court and we
establish her misconduct

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:26.529
as said paid employee,

00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:28.552
well, there's nothing
that changes policy faster

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:32.475
than a big,
expensive settlement.

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:38.040
We're going to prove once
and for all that God is dead.

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.549
Brooke is a minor.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:50.857
As far as the court is
concerned, she has no rights.

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:54.228
That simply means I won't
be asking her to be a witness.

00:28:54.366 --> 00:28:58.326
I feel supremely
confident about this.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.470
Okay.

00:29:18.724 --> 00:29:20.852
Injunctive relief?

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.325
They're asking
that you be fired,

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.555
plus revocation of
your teaching certificate.

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:26.028
What? How am I supposed to...

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.191
Plus attorney's fees.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.863
Essentially, you'll
lose everything.

00:29:32.971 --> 00:29:34.530
Why are they doing this?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.871
They want to make
an example of you.

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:39.240
To them, your beliefs
are like a disease

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:41.176
whose time has come and gone,

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.116
sort of like smallpox,
or polio, or the plague.

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:52.152
So, what do we do?

00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:54.283
We win.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.862
Hey, what's going on?

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:05.647
Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:06.764
Idiot.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.203
Hey, shut up, loser.

00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:09.317
At least she's
standing for something.

00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:10.604
Give me that.

00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:14.237
Brooke, you need to
stop this immediately.

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:16.440
Brooke, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:17.948
If you don't stop
this right now,

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:19.523
there are gonna be
some consequences.

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.144
Actually, I don't
think that there will,

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:24.120
because this is a sidewalk,
which is public property.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.157
My dad's a lawyer.

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:30.490
Well, actually, this sidewalk
is on school property.

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:33.292
I suggest you girls
aren't late for class.

00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:35.799
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.110
Hey, what are you doing?

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.844
I'm just, you know,
reading the paper

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:56.978
while my laptop goes through
my online jury orientation.

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:01.527
Well, shouldn't you
be paying attention?

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.027
Please remember, consumption
of alcoholic beverages,

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.393
nonprescription drugs,
and weapons are prohibited

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:08.022
in the courtroom.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:11.398
Still, isn't it your civic duty?

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:15.769
Theoretically, yeah,
but Matthew 22:14.

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:17.433
Oh, "Many are called,
few are chosen."

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.204
Exactly.

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.973
Three hundred people show
up, they sit around for 8 hours,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.174
and at the end of the
day, they all go home,

00:31:24.316 --> 00:31:26.046
having not been selected.

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:27.624
Statistically, I have
a better chance

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:31.156
of being hit by lightning.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:33.054
Gotta get some coffee.

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.523
All right.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.321
It's called "voir dire."

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:38.840
It means that we get a chance
to eliminate any potential jurors

00:31:38.864 --> 00:31:41.663
that may have a
bias against you.

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:43.133
- Sir.
- Oh!

00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:44.396
Thank you, sir.

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:45.536
So, how are you feeling?

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:47.128
I'm good.

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.150
All right, well, this is a
bit of an arduous process.

00:31:49.174 --> 00:31:51.552
They bring all these jurors in.
It's gonna take the whole day,

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.738
but I think this is where
we can win the case.

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:10.318
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Robert Stennis.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.462
On the order of the matter

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.260
of Thawley vs. Wesley,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.266
you may be seated.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.404
So, it says here...
What does it say?

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:24.442
It says you're a psychic.

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:26.545
Yes.

00:32:26.645 --> 00:32:28.375
Oh, do you know who's
gonna win this case?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.142
No, don't answer that.

00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:34.117
We're going to challenge
this juror, Your Honor.

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:39.054
Ms. Bailey, what's
your favorite TV show?

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.888
"Pretty Little Liars."

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:44.121
Peremptory
challenge, Your Honor.

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.358
What is your favorite TV show?

00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:52.131
"Duck Dynasty."

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.001
Peremptory
challenge, Your Honor.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.768
"Duck Dynasty."

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:59.639
Ms. Smith, are you
involved in any community

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:01.076
or charitable organizations?

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.580
Yes, the Salvation Army.

00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:05.548
We'll accept this
juror, Your Honor.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.610
Juror number nine,
you're a teacher.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.416
I'm a retired teacher.

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.652
Ever have any disciplinary
run-ins with the administration?

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:17.285
Never.

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.694
Acceptable to the
plaintiff, Your Honor.

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.322
Acceptable, Your Honor.

00:33:21.466 --> 00:33:23.332
Peremptory
challenge, Your Honor.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:24.834
We'll take her, Your Honor.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.370
Thank you, Mr. Cherry.

00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:28.804
Preemptive
challenge, Your Honor.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.308
Number two just screams Marine.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.708
I don't want him.

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.456
That would mean
blowing our last challenge.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.914
Well, we have no choice.

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.815
I mean, what part of
"God, Country, and Corps"

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.010
do you wanna put on that jury?

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:44.247
What was your
last paid position?

00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:48.657
Artillery Forward Observer,
United States Marine Corps.

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:51.353
Peremptory
challenge, Your Honor.

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:53.260
Thank you.

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:59.361
Your Honor, we'd like
to challenge for cause.

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.132
Why is that?

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:03.174
Oh, Your Honor, the
man's an ordained minister.

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:06.335
Need I say more?

00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:07.912
The juror is excused.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.038
Objection, Your Honor.

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.479
Basis, Mr. Endler?

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:13.347
Discriminatory, Your Honor.

00:34:13.485 --> 00:34:15.229
Peremptory challenges can
not be used to discriminate

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.381
against a certain class
of juror based on race,

00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:20.048
ethnic background,
religion, or gender.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.716
And the fact that
religious belief

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.355
is tangential to this
case doesn't change that.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.368
Upon further reflection,

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:33.563
I find the respondent's
assertion is correct.

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:35.003
Sustained.

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.803
You're not her pastor, are you?

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.207
No, Your Honor.

00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:40.870
Your Honor, I must protest here.

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:42.412
Mr. Kane,

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:44.547
now, you had a set number
of peremptory challenges,

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:46.812
all of which you have used.

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.012
Therefore, it's up
to opposing counsel.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.589
We accept him, Your Honor.

00:34:51.723 --> 00:34:53.419
Welcome to the jury, sir.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:56.926
Henceforth, juror number twelve.

00:34:57.062 --> 00:35:00.191
I hope you enjoy your
service to the community.

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.790
Better chance of being
struck by lightning.

00:35:07.906 --> 00:35:13.573
It amazes me how we,
as human beings, think.

00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:16.045
When I was battling for my life,

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:21.085
I was willing to hold onto
anything, including God,

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:22.797
even though I really
didn't believe in him

00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:25.586
until that moment.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.559
I was convinced that I felt him,

00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:34.258
but now that I'm
officially in remission,

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:37.461
I find myself
questioning everything.

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:45.305
So, effective immediately,
this blog is the personal diary

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:47.969
of one woman's
exploration of faith

00:35:48.113 --> 00:35:52.778
on her own terms, cancer-free.

00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:04.157
Hey, Martin. How's it going?

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:06.161
Very good, Pastor Dave.

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:07.663
Oh, please.

00:36:10.602 --> 00:36:14.630
You sure?

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.642
Well, it seems that for
every question you answered,

00:36:18.777 --> 00:36:21.144
three or four more
questions spring up.

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:24.010
Yeah, but that's a
good thing, right?

00:36:24.149 --> 00:36:27.347
It's like what Einstein
said about science.

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.681
Picture what you know
like the light of a candle.

00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:31.881
As the circle of
knowledge expands,

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:35.391
so does the circumference
of darkness around it.

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.928
So, I'm actually learning,

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.759
even though I
might not feel like it.

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.925
Yes, exactly.

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:46.095
Well, I've been
studying the Beatitudes.

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:48.639
They're very hard, one
might say impossible,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.868
to follow completely.

00:36:51.009 --> 00:36:53.274
Here in Luke's
account, Jesus says,

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:56.348
"Do unto others as you
have them do unto you."

00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:58.347
But how is that possible?

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.612
How can I react to the
needs of everyone else

00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:04.349
the same as my
own, even for one day,

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:06.151
let alone my whole life?

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:07.657
And how can I
reconcile my inability

00:37:07.726 --> 00:37:10.821
to do so with Scripture?

00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:14.798
Yeah, those are good questions.

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:18.392
Okay, scoot over.

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:21.536
What is that, Luke?

00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:23.972
Yes, 6:20.

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.135
"And Jesus said
to his disciples,

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:28.713
"" You who are poor are blessed

00:37:28.847 --> 00:37:30.839
"" because the
kingdom of God is yours.

00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:33.077
"" You who are now
hungry are blessed

00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:34.880
"" because you will be filled.

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:39.219
"" You who now weep are
blessed because you will laugh.

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:42.725
"" You are blessed when people
hate you, when they exclude you,

00:37:42.861 --> 00:37:45.831
"" insult you, and
slander your name as evil

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.865
because of the Son of Man. ""

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.013
You can't win.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.412
Thanks.

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:06.074
I'll take that under advisement.

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.709
Oh, come on, you know I'm right.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.118
I mean, why do it?

00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:11.917
Why go through this
whole exercise, huh?

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.581
Here, thanks.

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:16.422
You know, I looked
up your history.

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:18.621
You're better than this.

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.164
You were third in your
class at Stanford Law.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.859
You clerked for a judge
on the Ninth Circuit.

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.869
Why you slumming like this?

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.982
Maybe I believe that people
that don't do anything wrong

00:38:28.006 --> 00:38:30.976
shouldn't suffer at
the hands of the law.

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:33.840
You know what hate is, Tom?

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.658
I'm not talking about
the fairy tale stuff,

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:38.308
I mean real hate.

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:42.614
I hate what people
like your client stand for

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.519
and what they're
doing to our society,

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:49.617
and Stennis does, too,
even if he doesn't admit it.

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:51.252
Well, the jury doesn't hate her.

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.660
Ah, but that's the
secret, Tommy.

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.390
They don't need to hate her.

00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:59.631
They just need to see a
tiny flaw in her, a half-truth,

00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:03.139
a small inconsistency,
just a little bit of doubt,

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.800
and they'll find against her.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.477
Nice shoes.

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:27.393
You ready?

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:30.425
Come on.

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:32.265
Congress shall make no law

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.498
respecting an establishment

00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:39.044
of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.

00:39:39.177 --> 00:39:40.907
The first half of this passage

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.514
is known as the
establishment clause.

00:39:43.615 --> 00:39:48.519
The second half is known
as the free exercise clause.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.179
Now, there has been
an ongoing debate

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.722
about what the role of
government should be,

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.691
because in practice,
these two provisions

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.989
are often in conflict,

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:02.192
which is what
brings us here today.

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:05.030
In the matter of
Thawley vs. Wesley,

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:07.570
is the plaintiff prepared to
make its opening statement?

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.003
We are, Your Honor.

00:40:09.107 --> 00:40:11.440
Then proceed.

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:14.910
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a jury of this size,

00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:20.314
I'm imagining that there are,
probably among your ranks,

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:22.580
a few Christians.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.212
Hopefully practicing ones,

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.258
and that's a good
thing, that's fine,

00:40:28.393 --> 00:40:30.760
because Christianity
is not on trial here,

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:36.562
even though my opponent
will try to convince you that it is.

00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:40.002
Nor is faith on trial.

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:47.272
Only Ms. Wesley
is on trial here today.

00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:50.075
Now, ask any 4th grader

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:53.083
and they're probably
familiar with the phrase,

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:57.177
"Separation of
church and state,"

00:40:57.288 --> 00:41:01.817
and that is guaranteed
to us under our laws.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.293
The plaintiffs are the
parents of a student

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:08.958
in Ms. Wesley's class who
was subjected to hearing

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:13.265
the teachings of Jesus Christ
being favorably compared

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:15.566
to the teachings of
Mahatma Gandhi.

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:17.904
We all know that Jesus is part

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:23.107
of a particular
religious tradition.

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.773
These parents, who are
trying to raise their daughter

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:27.579
to be a free thinker,

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:30.450
free of any religious dogma,

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:34.889
are wholly offended by what
went on in that classroom.

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:37.485
And she, reciting the words

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:41.087
that were allegedly
attributed to Jesus,

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:44.101
who allegedly lived
2,000 years ago,

00:41:44.202 --> 00:41:49.106
gave a clear and
compelling indication

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:55.238
of what she believes,
what she supports,

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.577
what she endorses.

00:41:57.682 --> 00:41:59.412
Now, let me put it this way.

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:03.545
I don't mean to offend anyone
who may be a Muslim here,

00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:06.351
and I do not want to
slight the prophet of Islam,

00:42:06.491 --> 00:42:09.325
but if you were to ask me a
question concerning the Quran,

00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:11.487
the sacred text of Islam,

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:13.621
and I could come
up with the answer

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:16.326
with great speed and accuracy,

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:20.666
and I could quote the
proper surah, or chapter,

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:25.972
then it would be
reasonable for you to infer

00:42:26.077 --> 00:42:31.983
that I was not only
a follower of Islam,

00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:34.985
but that I considered
it to be superior

00:42:35.086 --> 00:42:37.715
to all other forms of religion.

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:43.692
If I did this in a house of
worship, that would be fine.

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:48.789
But if I did it in an 11th grade
classroom in a public school,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.167
that would be
preaching, not teaching.

00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:55.866
So, why? Why in the
world are we here today?

00:42:56.007 --> 00:43:00.411
Why? Because Ms.
Wesley refused to apologize,

00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:02.207
and that means that
her true motivation

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:05.180
in that moment in her classroom

00:43:05.283 --> 00:43:09.516
was to take an innocent question

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:17.027
and turn it into an opportunity
to preach, not teach.

00:43:17.128 --> 00:43:22.533
If we grant Ms. Wesley
the right to do that,

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:25.398
and by extension, everyone else,

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:32.000
to violate the law based
solely on our own private beliefs,

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.877
then our society will crumble.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.539
I believe that.

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:42.643
So, I implore you, please
do not set this precedent.

00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:44.312
Do not.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:47.289
The future of our
republic depends on it.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.104
What's going on?

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.248
Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.

00:44:06.344 --> 00:44:08.904
Brooke, I need you to
stop this immediately.

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.744
Brooke, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:15.081
If you don't stop right now,
there are gonna be consequences.

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:17.687
Hey, Aunt Amy.

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:19.256
Hey, Marlene.

00:44:19.357 --> 00:44:21.087
Yeah, I just saw the
video, what's going on?

00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:22.626
So, you remember
my friend, Brooke?

00:44:22.727 --> 00:44:23.922
Yeah.

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.553
Well, she got a
teacher in trouble

00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:26.756
for asking her about Jesus.

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.332
What?

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:30.110
Now she's not even
supposed to talk about it

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:32.262
and we can't even cover
it in our school paper.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.839
Is there any way that
I could meet with her?

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.739
- The teacher?
- No, Brooke.

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:43.681
Mr. Endler, your
opening statement.

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:47.615
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:50.017
I have here a copy
of the Constitution

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.986
of the United States of America

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:53.819
and its Bill of Rights,

00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:56.689
arguably the two most
important documents

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:59.023
in the history of
our great nation.

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:03.032
But despite Mr. Kane's
impassioned rhetoric,

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.398
you know what you
won't find in there

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:07.198
no matter how hard you look?

00:45:07.338 --> 00:45:12.470
The phrase "Separation
of church and state."

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:14.205
That's right.

00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:17.213
It's not in there,
never has been,

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:18.692
because that phrase
comes from a letter

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:21.151
written by Thomas Jefferson.

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:23.016
Now, ironically,
Jefferson was writing

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:25.817
to a Baptist congregation,
ensuring them

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:27.516
that they would
always have the right

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:31.561
to believe as they wished,
free of government interference.

00:45:31.696 --> 00:45:35.224
But lately, that phrase has
been taken out of context

00:45:35.366 --> 00:45:37.426
and twisted and contorted

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:39.469
to mean the exact opposite.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.098
And one morning early this
year, my client, Ms. Wesley,

00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:44.869
she woke up as usual,

00:45:44.976 --> 00:45:47.241
she drove to work at
her job as a teacher

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:49.040
at Martin Luther
King High School,

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:52.082
a place where she was
Teacher of the Year.

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.583
Her lesson plan for
second period A.P. history

00:45:54.719 --> 00:45:59.020
that morning, it didn't include
any mention of God or Jesus.

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:02.924
She didn't have a Bible
sitting on her desk in plain view.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.571
She didn't start her
class with a blessing.

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.257
She didn't lead her
students in prayer.

00:46:06.397 --> 00:46:12.268
No, all she did was
answer a question,

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:15.840
because that is what
she gets paid to do.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.910
Now, Mr. Kane will
insist loudly and often

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:21.035
that faith isn't on trial here,

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:23.410
but that is exactly
what is on trial,

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:27.712
the most basic human right
of all, the right to believe.

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:30.811
Mr. Kane's afraid.

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:36.792
He's afraid that you, the jury,
the touchstone of common sense,

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.294
might not agree with
his tortured interpretation

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.797
of the Constitution,

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:45.300
that you might understand
that my client has rights,

00:46:45.436 --> 00:46:50.568
rights that trump his agenda,
and that in realizing that

00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:52.735
you will hold as I do

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.438
that my client is
guilty of no wrongdoing

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:59.675
and innocent of any
and all claims against her.

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:03.981
Thank you very much.

00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:14.141
And now it's become
this huge deal,

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:17.465
and all she did was
answer my question.

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.264
Why do you think your
parents are doing this?

00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:22.704
Because my mom thinks
it'll help me get into Stanford

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:28.006
or one of the Ivys, and my
dad thinks it'll help pay for it.

00:47:28.145 --> 00:47:29.670
And nobody's asked
you what you think?

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:31.442
No.

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:35.645
So, are you gonna help her?

00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:38.518
I don't know.

00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:41.421
I would at least
like to talk to her.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:44.017
Maybe I could help
get her story out there.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:47.529
Great, because everyone's
telling me to stay out of it.

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.031
Do you always do
what you're told?

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.835
What is your heart
telling you to do?

00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.405
Mr. Thawley, how did you
feel when you found out

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.604
that your daughter
had been exposed

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.808
to faith-based
teachings in class?

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.680
Well, it felt like we
had been violated.

00:48:07.785 --> 00:48:09.629
I mean, this was supposed
to be a history class,

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.178
not Sunday school.

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:13.018
My wife and I are free thinkers.

00:48:13.124 --> 00:48:14.615
We're rationalists.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.285
We believe in a
non-theistic world view,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.625
and that's how we were
trying to raise our daughter.

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.994
And did you discuss this
incident with your daughter?

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.794
Well, I tried,

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.578
but it's hard discussing
anything with kids that age.

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:26.093
She's 16.

00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:28.399
Some of you know
what that's like.

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:31.099
It's hard enough trying to
maintain credibility as a parent

00:48:31.242 --> 00:48:33.006
without a teacher jumping in

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.976
and arguing
against your position.

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:37.057
Now, we trust the school
not to overstep its bounds

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.380
in terms of what is and
what isn't appropriate.

00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:40.849
Is that too much to ask?

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:42.419
No. Thank you, Mr. Thawley.

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.112
That's all, Your Honor.

00:48:44.255 --> 00:48:46.724
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

00:48:46.824 --> 00:48:48.759
No questions, Your Honor.

00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:51.488
Next witness, Mr. Kane.

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:56.590
Mrs. Rizzo, did Ms. Wesley
talk about faith issues

00:48:56.734 --> 00:48:58.225
on the school campus?

00:48:58.369 --> 00:48:59.667
All the time.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.830
Everybody knows
she's a Christian.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.408
I don't think she'd chew a
stick of gum without praying first.

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:06.602
It makes everyone feel awkward.

00:49:06.744 --> 00:49:08.235
Thank you.

00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:10.746
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:13.214
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:17.587
Mrs. Rizzo, you
stated that Ms. Wesley

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:20.088
talks about her
faith all the time.

00:49:20.191 --> 00:49:24.390
I'm curious, can you give
me a specific instance?

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:27.124
Well, not off the
top of my head.

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:29.290
Well, has she, as
far as you're aware,

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.231
ever started her
class with a prayer?

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.031
No.

00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:35.115
Has she ever asked anyone
in the teacher's lounge

00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:36.139
to pray with her?

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.868
No.

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.342
Has she ever asked you
personally to pray with her?

00:49:40.478 --> 00:49:41.639
Objection, Your Honor.

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:43.270
- No.
- Cumulative.

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:45.781
The question has effectively
been asked and answered.

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:48.284
Your Honor, Mrs. Rizzo's
sworn testimony states

00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:51.287
that Ms. Wesley talked
about her faith all the time,

00:49:51.422 --> 00:49:53.323
yet she's failed to
cite a single instance.

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:56.621
I'm merely trying to discover
some basis for her opinion.

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.422
Sustained.

00:49:58.529 --> 00:50:00.407
Mr. Endler, we're done
with this line of questioning.

00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:02.991
Mrs. Rizzo, in the
school's initial inquiry

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:05.625
into this matter, you were
Ms. Wesley's representative

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:06.980
on behalf of the
teacher's union,

00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:07.869
were you not?

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.473
Yes.

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:10.984
And did you ever consider
that your disapproval

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:13.944
of her faith might
taint your ability

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.307
to represent her properly?

00:50:15.446 --> 00:50:16.623
Objection, speculative.

00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:17.706
Sustained.

00:50:19.283 --> 00:50:20.751
God bless you.

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.329
Careful, or you
might end up on trial.

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:25.289
Mr. Endler!

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:27.483
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:33.464
So, when are these
religious zealots

00:50:33.564 --> 00:50:36.363
going to realize it's not
only disrespectful of them

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.298
to push their beliefs on others,

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:40.928
in this case, it's
actually illegal?

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:44.839
This woman, this fundamentalist,
used her position of influence

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:49.037
as a teacher to fill the minds
of our children with nonsense.

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.977
If you ask me, the
religious extremists

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:54.518
we need to worry about
are the hard-core Christians.

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:57.611
How about we show up in force
and show Ms. Wesley just exactly

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:00.020
what we think of
her proselytizing?

00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:01.691
Principal Kinney, what was

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:05.126
the school district's
final determination?

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:07.858
Well, Grace has been
suspended without pay

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:10.399
pending the
result of this trial.

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:13.163
Isn't it rather unusual,
leaving it up to a third party

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:17.332
to determine whether
Ms. Wesley is fired?

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:19.081
We've decided to accept

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:21.371
the court's interpretation
of wrongdoing either way.

00:51:21.512 --> 00:51:22.810
No questions, Your Honor.

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.424
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:25.916
Ms. Kinney,

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:28.383
can you tell me the full
name of the high school

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:30.010
over which you preside?

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.579
Doctor Martin Luther King
Junior Memorial High School.

00:51:33.724 --> 00:51:35.556
I noticed that the
name fails to mention

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:38.151
Dr. King's title as
Reverend Doctor.

00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:40.629
It's his work in the
field of civil rights

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.357
that we prefer to highlight.

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.196
But that's the whole point.

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:46.065
You consider his
faith and politics

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:48.263
to be separate things,

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:51.034
but I don't, and he
certainly wouldn't have.

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.575
Objection, Your Honor.

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.167
Counsel is testifying.

00:51:54.278 --> 00:51:56.076
Sustained.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:52:00.207
Jury's instructed to ignore
Mr. Endler's preceding remarks.

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:02.411
Ms. Kinney, are you
familiar with Dr. King's letter

00:52:02.553 --> 00:52:03.987
from the Birmingham Jail?

00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:05.198
Yes, it's a seminal piece

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.157
of civil rights history.

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:09.783
In that letter Dr. King
makes numerous

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:11.793
faith-based
references, does he not?

00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:13.955
Offhand, I don't recall.

00:52:14.098 --> 00:52:17.125
Allow me to refresh your memory.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:22.130
He cites the example
of the three youths

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:25.367
from the book of Daniel who
were tossed into the fiery furnace

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:28.446
by King Nebuchadnezzar
because they refused to worship him.

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:31.105
Elsewhere, he urges
action with Jesus,

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:33.945
and here I quote,
"Extremist love."

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:36.011
And in his speech, "I've
Been to the Mountaintop,"

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.420
he stated that he just
wanted to do God's will.

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:41.116
Is this coming back to you now?

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.590
Yes.

00:52:42.693 --> 00:52:44.286
In your opinion,
would Ms. Wesley,

00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:46.887
had she chosen to do so,
have been allowed to present

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.675
the examples that I just
mentioned in her class?

00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:50.292
Objection, speculative.

00:52:50.401 --> 00:52:51.845
I'm going to allow it.

00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:53.167
Overruled.

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:55.295
Witness may answer.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.599
No.

00:52:57.708 --> 00:53:00.837
If it were up to me, she
would not have been allowed.

00:53:00.978 --> 00:53:02.446
Why not?

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.890
Because those examples

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.158
are too closely
associated with faith.

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:06.946
In other words, they're facts,

00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:10.818
but they're just facts that are
too dangerous for discussion?

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:13.446
The word I would use
would be "controversial."

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.459
But aren't facts just facts?

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.119
I mean, there's
nothing controversial

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:22.666
about 2 plus 2 equaling
4, or E equals MC squared,

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.758
or the date man
landed on the moon.

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:27.167
So, why the controversy
about these facts?

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:29.137
I think the fact that
we're all here today

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:31.231
speaks for itself.

00:53:34.078 --> 00:53:36.138
Thank you for your honesty.

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.476
One last question.

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:41.882
In your orientation

00:53:42.019 --> 00:53:43.487
at the beginning
of the semester,

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:47.524
your memo to the staff
stressed diversity and tolerance,

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:49.217
did it not?

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.055
Yes.

00:53:51.195 --> 00:53:54.256
Well, would it be fair to say
that except for Christianity,

00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:56.367
all other forms of
diversity are welcome?

00:53:56.467 --> 00:53:57.730
Objection!

00:53:57.868 --> 00:53:58.868
Your Honor!

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.664
I will withdraw the question.

00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:02.749
Mr. Endler, you seem
to have a penchant

00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:05.436
for injecting commentary
where it doesn't belong.

00:54:05.576 --> 00:54:07.738
You would do well to
avoid further provocation

00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:09.506
of this court.

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.582
I apologize, Your Honor.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.583
I'll look to curtail
it in the future.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.454
Redirect, Your Honor?

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.685
Ms. Kinney, I understand
that you attended a service

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:27.458
at Ms. Wesley's
church a short while ago.

00:54:27.598 --> 00:54:28.930
Is that correct?

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:30.694
Yes, that's correct.

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:33.703
It was an event honoring several
students who attend that church

00:54:33.804 --> 00:54:35.067
for their community service.

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:36.697
Mm-hmm.

00:54:36.807 --> 00:54:39.709
And who was it that
invited you to that service?

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.073
Grace Wesley.

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.702
I see.

00:54:42.813 --> 00:54:45.715
And where were you when
this invitation was extended?

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:47.114
At my office.

00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:48.583
On school grounds?

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:50.620
Yes.

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:53.053
During work hours?

00:54:53.157 --> 00:54:55.888
Yes.

00:54:55.993 --> 00:54:58.121
Thank you.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.431
Oh, one last question.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:05.900
Is it true that Ms.
Wesley accepts donations

00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:11.237
for a faith-based
charity, Convoy of Hope,

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:14.334
right there in the classroom?

00:55:14.478 --> 00:55:16.572
Yes, she does.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.148
Thank you again.

00:55:18.282 --> 00:55:20.615
No further questions,
Your Honor.

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:27.352
You may step down, Mrs. Kinney.

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:29.255
Court's adjourned.

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:37.063
Grace, can I ask you a question,

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.398
off the record?

00:55:39.503 --> 00:55:40.937
Sure.

00:55:41.038 --> 00:55:43.007
These people, they're
looking to destroy you,

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:47.009
and I don't just
mean financially.

00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:49.113
Do you think it's worth it?

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.748
I hope so.

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:58.782
So do I.

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.662
Fishy and cheesy
at the same time.

00:56:15.806 --> 00:56:17.866
David, this tuna
melt is exquisite.

00:56:18.008 --> 00:56:19.567
Oh, yeah, exquisite.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.201
It's the provolone.

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:22.813
That was my idea.

00:56:22.913 --> 00:56:25.781
I love what it does to
the flavor of the fish.

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:27.317
Don't I know you?

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:28.976
You're from Blaze's
Car Rental, right?

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:30.679
Oh, yeah.

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:34.155
Yeah, that gig didn't
really work out for me.

00:56:34.258 --> 00:56:36.591
I don't think customer
service is my forte.

00:56:36.727 --> 00:56:38.696
So, you decided
to become a waiter?

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:40.661
Well, this is where I
do my dinner theatre.

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.494
In the mornings I
serve up croissants.

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.363
In the evenings I
serve up Chekhov.

00:56:44.468 --> 00:56:45.993
Oh.

00:56:46.103 --> 00:56:50.370
Hey, listen, sorry about the
whole car not working thing.

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:51.839
It's okay.

00:56:51.942 --> 00:56:53.535
I learned my lesson.

00:56:53.677 --> 00:56:54.975
He bought a Prius.

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.546
Starts every time.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.046
Oh!

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:02.849
- Same guy.
- Same guy.

00:57:02.953 --> 00:57:06.048
Amazing.

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:10.456
Gentlemen, I don't
wanna spoil your brunch,

00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:13.564
but I'm hearing
from a friend of mine

00:57:13.664 --> 00:57:15.860
in the prosecutor's
office about a subpoena

00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:20.370
that just came down
demanding that we submit

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:26.933
copies of our sermons for
the last 3 months for review.

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:30.780
Can they do that?

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.883
They tried it in Houston.

00:57:32.983 --> 00:57:34.383
So, now the government
can determine

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.715
what we can and can't
preach at our churches?

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.254
Let's not overreact.

00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:40.085
I'm sure there's
no ill intent here.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:44.127
Unfortunately, I think
this is just the beginning.

00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:49.290
We've been ignoring it, and
now we're paying the price for it.

00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:51.698
Well, don't forget
the silent majority.

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:53.134
They're out there.

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:55.205
They just need
something to stand for.

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:58.036
Well I'll admit there's
pressure, but I think with time

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.769
this will correct itself.

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:03.711
Forgive me, but I
think you're wrong.

00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:05.578
I'm serving on a jury
in a case right now

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.275
that touches on these issues.

00:58:07.417 --> 00:58:09.228
And of course, I'm not
allowed to talk about it,

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.313
but I mean, the one thing
that it's convinced me of

00:58:12.456 --> 00:58:14.823
is that if we stand
by and do nothing,

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:16.426
pressure that
we're feeling today

00:58:16.526 --> 00:58:18.461
is gonna mean
persecution tomorrow.

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.564
What makes you so sure?

00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:25.625
Speed of change,
viciousness of the opposition.

00:58:25.736 --> 00:58:27.776
The message of the gospel
has us standing in the way

00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:30.034
of a lot of things that
powerful people want,

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.972
and our resistance to
change that message

00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.512
because it's not ours to change
has made us a lot of enemies.

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.343
Whether we admit it
or not, we're at war,

00:58:39.483 --> 00:58:42.317
the war of Ephesians 6,
not against flesh and blood,

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.546
but against the
powers of this world,

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:47.988
against the spiritual forces
in the heavenly realms.

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:53.189
And if we insist
on denying that,

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.095
then we've already lost.

00:59:09.079 --> 00:59:10.809
I brought a giant
bag of Chinese food

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:12.712
and a briefcase full of files.

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.977
I say we eat first.

00:59:15.085 --> 00:59:16.610
I say you're a genius.

00:59:18.155 --> 00:59:19.589
Does Walter want to join us?

00:59:19.723 --> 00:59:22.056
Oh, no. He's hiding in his room.

00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:23.717
How come?

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.489
He's treating this
like it's a date,

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.292
which should give
you some indication

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.026
of what my social life is like.

00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:31.692
Don't worry, I won't tell.

00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:34.670
Falls under
attorney-client privilege.

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:36.549
So, is this what you
always saw yourself doing,

00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.098
the lawyer thing?

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.176
No, um...

00:59:40.277 --> 00:59:43.372
I wanted to be Batman.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.039
How 'bout you?

00:59:45.182 --> 00:59:47.182
Your parents have you
all set to go to the convent?

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.344
Actually, there were
no bedtime prayers

00:59:49.453 --> 00:59:50.751
in my childhood.

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:54.085
I was raised in a house
without much faith.

00:59:54.224 --> 00:59:56.693
When did you decide
to become a Christian?

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:59.058
I was walking home from class.

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:05.432
It was dark, and I was
struggling with a lot of things.

01:00:05.569 --> 01:00:06.901
And I turned the corner,

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:09.529
and right there in front
of me was this church.

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:12.438
It had this old sign out front,

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.603
but it just stopped
me in my tracks.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:20.911
And the sign... the sign said,

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:25.079
"Who do you say that I am?"

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:30.854
And as I read it, I could
hear the Lord speak to me.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.858
You know,

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.563
I couldn't get that question
out of my head for days,

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.969
so that was the start of
a journey that didn't end

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.632
until I found the answer.

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:48.844
♪ Nearer, my God, to thee ♪

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:57.558
♪ Nearer to thee ♪

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:08.323
That was beautiful.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.071
Forgive me, but I did not
know anyone was here.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.354
Oh, no. Please don't apologize.

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:19.679
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:23.083
I just didn't know
where else to go.

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:26.547
I'm Martin.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:28.021
I'm Brooke.

01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:33.093
Do you think I could
ask you a few questions?

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.029
That would be fine.

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.037
Good, 'cause I have a lot.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:52.377
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.780
But I thought you proved bias.

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.477
I mean, Principal
Kinney and Mrs. Rizzo?

01:05:55.585 --> 01:05:57.053
Those were just jabs.

01:05:57.153 --> 01:06:00.282
We need a knockout punch.

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:01.891
Why did you feel compelled

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.756
to bring Jesus up
in history class?

01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:07.827
Why shouldn't I have?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.229
Grace, I'm not here
to debate with you

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.773
what you think
your rights were as...

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:14.736
No, Tom, listen.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.103
This isn't about faith.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:19.233
This is about history.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.708
Okay, maybe I'm wrong here.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.142
I'm not the law expert,

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:26.272
but I think they've
missed the point.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:28.146
I'm not sure I follow.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:31.254
Their whole attack, it's
about me preaching in class,

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:32.879
but I didn't do that.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.480
They're saying you did.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.183
You cited Scripture.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.295
You talked about
Jesus' teachings just like

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:41.887
they were any
other verifiable fact.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.626
But what if they're just that?

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.396
I mean, just because certain
facts happen to be recorded

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.302
in the Bible doesn't
mean they stop being facts.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.271
We can separate the
history-based elements

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:54.606
of Jesus' life from the
faith-based element.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.180
I mean, in my classroom,
I didn't talk about Jesus

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.475
as my Lord and Savior.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.608
You know, all I did was
comment on quotations

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:05.450
attributed to Jesus, the man,
and I did it in A.P. History.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.183
There was nothing
wrong with the context.

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.985
And any rule saying
that you can talk

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:11.118
about any historic
figure that ever existed

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.061
except Jesus is discriminatory.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.790
They can't institute that.

01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:18.334
And every credible historian
admits that Jesus existed.

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:19.954
I mean, there's just
too much evidence.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.766
Grace, I love it.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.533
This is our defense.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:26.973
Jesus as a historic figure,
just like everyone else.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.635
And you know what?

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:31.044
Kane will never see it coming.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.858
You got some reading to do.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.358
He just had so many
notes written in the margins

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:52.162
that for the first
time I felt like I was

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:54.737
truly getting to
know my brother.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:58.364
Like God gave me
the extra 5 minutes

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.466
that I so desperately
needed with him.

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:06.509
I just don't understand why
he never told me about his faith.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.211
Sharing one's faith with family,

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:12.687
especially not knowing
how they will react,

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:15.315
can be difficult.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.759
Count our struggles
as blessings, right?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.891
That is exactly right.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:31.764
There are more than 5 minutes
awaiting you and your brother.

01:08:31.908 --> 01:08:36.209
John chapter 11,
verse 25 to 26 says,

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:38.747
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:43.444
"He who believes in me
will live even if he dies.

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:46.078
"And whoever lives
and believes in me

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.420
will never die."

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.961
Do you believe this?

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:53.825
I do.

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:56.262
Then invite him into your heart

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.096
and make him the
Lord of your life.

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:14.614
Dear Lord, I'm not
quite sure what to say,

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:21.089
but thank you for dying
on the cross for me.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:25.659
Please forgive me of my sin.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:29.664
Jesus, please come into my life,

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:32.997
and I will follow you
as my Lord and Savior.

01:09:35.972 --> 01:09:37.838
Amen.

01:09:47.984 --> 01:09:49.953
Thank you.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.163
Can you state your name
and occupation for the court?

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.788
My name is Lee Strobel.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:04.299
I'm a professor of
Christian thought

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.995
at Houston Baptist University

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.661
and the author of more than
20 books about Christianity,

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.865
including "The Case for Christ."

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.307
Can you help me prove the
existence of Jesus Christ?

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.209
Absolutely, beyond
any reasonable doubt.

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:18.837
How so?

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.626
Actually, this court
already affirmed it

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.142
when we were called into
session and the date was given.

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:27.053
Our calendar has been
split between B.C. and A.D.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.818
based on the birth of Jesus,

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:31.190
which is quite a feat
if he never existed.

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:34.354
Beyond that, historian
Gary Habermas

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:38.025
lists 39 ancient
sources for Jesus,

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.660
from which he enumerates
more than 100 reported facts

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:46.436
about his life, teachings,
crucifixion, and resurrection.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.740
In fact, the historical
evidence for Jesus' execution

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:52.678
is so strong that one
of the most famous

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:55.013
New Testament
scholars in the world,

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:58.577
Gerd Ludemann of
Germany, said, "Jesus' death

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:02.351
as a consequence of
crucifixion is indisputable."

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.018
Now, there are very few
facts in ancient history

01:11:05.128 --> 01:11:07.563
that a critical historian
like Gerd Ludemann

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.189
will say is indisputable.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:13.428
One of them is the
execution of Jesus Christ.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.114
Forgive me, but
you're a believer,

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:16.470
are you not?

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:17.767
A Bible-believing Christian?

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.375
Guilty as charged.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:22.104
So, wouldn't this tend
to inflate your estimate

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:24.942
of the probability
that Jesus existed.

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:27.380
No, because we
don't need to inflate it.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.749
We can reconstruct the
basic facts about Jesus

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:34.915
just from non-Christian
sources outside the Bible.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:37.789
And Gerd Ludemann is an atheist.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:41.295
In other words, we can
prove the existence of Jesus

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.956
solely by using sources
that have absolutely

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.433
no sympathy toward Christianity.

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:49.562
As the agnostic historian,
Bart Ehrman, says,

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:53.905
"Jesus did exist,
whether we like it or not."

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.104
I put it this way:

01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:59.808
Denying the existence of
Jesus doesn't make him go away.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:04.148
It merely proves that no amount
of evidence will convince you.

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:05.812
Thank you.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:08.823
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.087
Mr. Kane, your witness.

01:12:12.195 --> 01:12:14.323
No questions, Your Honor.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.761
That's lunch.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:18.266
We'll recess until 2 p.m.

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.777
Can I help you with something?

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.642
Oh, hi.

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:33.545
I was looking for Pastor Dave.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:37.643
My friend, Mina, she said
I should come see him.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:40.621
She said he's
real easy to talk to.

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.624
He won't be back
until after next week.

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.819
Oh, okay. Thanks.

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.261
Sweeping is something
I only do part-time.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.163
I enjoy it because
it helps me think.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:56.000
But if you need to talk,
I'm actually a pastor.

01:12:58.241 --> 01:13:02.508
It's been 3 weeks
since my doctors told me

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:04.045
I was in remission.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.791
Oh, Amy, that's wonderful.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:06.815
It is.

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:08.511
Yes.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:13.488
But even though I've
been given this gift,

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:17.651
I've been questioning my faith.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.698
I know Jesus existed, but
I'm struggling to believe.

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:25.392
Actually, I think you
already do believe,

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.799
and the proof is you're
not willing to put God

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.033
back on the shelf now
that your cancer is gone.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.668
He won't let you dismiss
the thought of him.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.905
Part of you senses
Jesus' presence

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:41.177
and wishes that he would just
go away and leave you alone.

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:43.776
Actually, now
that you mention it,

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.048
I had thought of that.

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:51.286
Look, he delights in using us
in ways we never dreamed of

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:55.364
and giving us things that we
never even knew we wanted.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:58.559
We just have to
give him a chance.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:00.660
Will you?

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.744
Thank you.

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.309
Hi, I'm Reverend David Hill.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.443
Sermon transcripts, right?

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:19.054
- Yes.
- Just put it right there.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:21.386
They've been
coming in all morning.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:27.221
I'm sure they did what
they thought was best.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.064
That's it?

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.571
Those are your entire
sermons for the past 120 days?

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:38.368
No, that's a letter that I wrote

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.638
explaining why I'm not
going to hand them in.

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:43.871
Excuse me?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.744
I know it's unusual
for a Christian pastor

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.476
to willfully resist a subpoena

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:50.279
issued by a lawful
government authority,

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:51.752
and it's even more unusual

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:54.915
that he should feel
compelled to do so.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:58.859
Are you sure you wanna do that?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.658
It's something
that I have to do.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:03.442
You know the old saying,
"The squeaky wheel

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:05.492
gets the grease," don't you?

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.603
I have another saying:

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:12.232
"A nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:43.134
Susan, what I'm seeing
is a teacher who answered

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:45.299
a student's question
to the best of her ability.

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:46.985
Amy, it sounds like
you're taking the side

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.307
of Grace Wesley here.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:50.539
Surely, you see that she
used the student's question

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:52.375
to promote her Christian agenda.

01:15:52.515 --> 01:15:54.507
Actually, Susan,
that's not how I see it.

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:57.143
I believe Ms. Wesley's
entitled to her own opinions,

01:15:57.253 --> 01:15:59.017
and that includes
in the classroom.

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.647
She didn't try to convert
these students, in fact...

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.022
Amy, I must say, I'm
shocked at what seems to be

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:07.654
a complete 180 from the
typical stance of your plot.

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:09.857
Just look at the facts
of this case for a minute.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:13.231
She clearly infringed on
the rights of her students.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:15.167
Marlene?

01:16:15.271 --> 01:16:16.762
I have an idea.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.306
Come over as soon
as you can, okay?

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.708
You look terrible.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.256
You really ought to
ask to be excused.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.543
No, no, I'm fine.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.946
I really need to be here.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:30.053
All rise.

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:36.183
You may be seated.

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:38.236
Juror number 12, is there
something you'd like to say?

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.059
I'm sorry, Your
Honor, I gotta...

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.896
Bailiff, call paramedics.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:45.695
Sir.

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.479
Well, I guess that
proves there is no God,

01:16:47.503 --> 01:16:48.903
'cause they just
lost the only juror

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.201
they could count on.

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:54.775
Any dizziness?

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.674
- Yeah.
- Vomiting?

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.077
About a half hour ago.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.454
Does this hurt? How 'bout this?

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:02.160
I hope you're not too attached

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:03.184
to your appendix.

01:17:27.443 --> 01:17:29.605
Brooke! Marlene.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.646
It's not looking good in there.

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:04.476
Ms. Marshall, are
you prepared to fulfill

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.172
your duties as an alternate?

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:08.307
Yes, I am, Your Honor.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.352
Mr. Endler, next witness.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:13.149
Would you state your name
and experience for the record?

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.883
My name is James Warner Wallace.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:17.755
I'm a retired homicide detective
from Los Angeles County.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.295
And are you the author of the
book, "Cold Case Christianity"?

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:21.989
Yes, I am.

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:24.794
Can you share the subtitle of
the book with the court, please?

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.266
"A Homicide Detective

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.928
Investigates the
Claims of the Gospels."

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.323
Would I be correct in saying

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.636
that your duties as
a homicide detective

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:33.868
include investigating
cold case homicides?

01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.444
Yes, that is and
was my expertise.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.606
Don't most of those cases
get solved with DNA evidence?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.240
Objection, leading.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.409
And counsel is testifying
again, Your Honor.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.850
I'll rephrase.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:47.583
How many of your
cold cases were solved

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.521
through the use of DNA evidence?

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.217
None. Not one.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.794
That's often popular on TV,

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.506
but our departments
never had the good fortune

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.590
of solving a cold case with DNA.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.894
Well, how do most of
these cases get solved?

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:01.026
Often by examining
eyewitness claims,

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.298
witness claims that were
made many years earlier,

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.273
even though often our
witnesses are now deceased.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.886
Forgive my
ignorance, Mr. Wallace,

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.879
but how is that possible?

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:11.845
Well, we have a number
of techniques we can use

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.547
to test the reliability
of an eyewitness,

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:16.949
including something called
forensic statement analysis.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.563
That's a discipline where
we scrutinize the statements

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.953
of eyewitnesses

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.733
and looking at what
they choose to minimize,

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:24.090
what they choose to emphasize,
what they omit altogether,

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:26.695
how they expand
time or contract time.

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:29.321
And when we examine these
kinds of eyewitness accounts,

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.991
we can usually tell who's
lying, and who's telling the truth,

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.297
and even who
the guilty party is.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.337
And did you apply
this skill set anytime

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.339
outside of your
official capacity?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.535
Yes, I applied my expertise
to the death of Jesus

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:42.976
at the hands of the Romans,

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:45.172
and I actually
looked at the gospels

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:48.445
as I would any other set
of forensic statements.

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:49.882
Within a matter of months,

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.544
I determined that
the four gospels,

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.213
written from
different perspectives,

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:56.417
contained the eyewitness
accounts about the life,

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:59.154
ministry, death, and
resurrection of Jesus.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.106
And did you consider
that the four accounts

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.565
might be part of a conspiracy,

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:06.158
designed to promote
belief in a fledgling faith?

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.679
Yeah, you have to
consider conspiracies

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.535
when assessing
eyewitness accounts,

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.072
but successful conspiracies

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:13.938
typically involve the
fewest number of people.

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:16.203
It's a lot easier for 2 people
to lie and keep a secret

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.974
than it is for 20.

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:19.958
And that's really the problem
with the conspiracy theories

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.780
related to the apostles
in the 1st century.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.408
There are just far
too many of them

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:24.851
trying to hold this conspiracy

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.307
for far too long
a period of time.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:27.913
And far worse,

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.424
they're experiencing
pressure like no other,

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:31.892
unimaginable pressure.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:34.691
Every one of these folks
was tortured and died

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.162
for what they claimed to see,

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:39.097
and none of them ever
recanted their story.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:42.694
So, the idea that this is a
conspiracy in the 1st century

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.363
is just really unreasonable.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.099
Instead, what I
see in the gospels

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:49.474
is something I call unintended
eyewitness support statement.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:52.013
What's an unintended
eyewitness support statement?

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:54.013
If I can borrow your Bible?

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:00.886
Let me go to the
Gospel of Matthew

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.150
for an example of this.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:03.816
I'll start with a passage

01:21:03.926 --> 01:21:06.521
in which Jesus is in front
of Caiaphas at a hearing.

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.597
It says here, "Then
they spit in his face

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.495
"and struck him
with their fists.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:12.032
"Others slapped him and said,

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.466
'Prophesy to us,
Christ. Who hit you? ""

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.250
Now, that seems like
a very simple request,

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.670
given that the
people who hit him

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:18.917
are standing right
in front of him.

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:20.500
This makes no sense.

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:23.305
Why would it be prophecy to
be able to tell you who hit you?

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:26.109
But it's not until you read Luke
that you get an answer to this.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.912
He says, "The men
who were guarding Jesus

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:31.077
"began mocking and beating him.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.086
"They blindfolded
him and demanded,

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:34.520
'Prophesy, who hit you? ""

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:36.615
So, now we know why
this was a challenge,

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.703
'cause Luke tells us the
thing that Matthew left out,

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.039
that he was actually blindfolded
at the time this took place.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.497
This is very common,

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:44.567
this kind of unintentional
eyewitness support

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.932
that fills in a detail that
the first witness left out.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.699
After years of scrutinizing
these gospels using the template

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:53.570
that I use to determine if
an eyewitness is reliable,

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:56.338
I concluded that the
four gospels in this book

01:21:56.445 --> 01:22:00.712
contained the reliable accounts
of the actual words of Jesus.

01:22:02.818 --> 01:22:04.548
And that's to include
the statements

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.712
quoted by Ms.
Wesley in her class?

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:11.156
Absolutely.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.889
Thank you, Detective.

01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:17.398
Your witness.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:19.661
Detective Wallace,

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:24.638
I'm not gonna try to match
biblical knowledge with you.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:28.266
But isn't it true that these
gospel accounts vary widely

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:29.901
in what they say,

01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:31.289
that there are
numerous discrepancies

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.145
between these accounts?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:37.276
Absolutely, but that's exactly
what we should expect.

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:39.581
I don't quite understand that.

01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:41.132
Well, reliable eyewitness
accounts always differ slightly

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:42.300
in the way they
recall the story.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.917
They're coming to it

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.437
from different geographic
perspectives, their history,

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.089
even where they are
located in the room.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:49.425
When I examined the gospels,
I was trying to determine

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.625
if these were accurate,
reliable accounts,

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.360
in spite of any differences

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.529
there might be
between the accounts.

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.630
Ah, and as a devout Christian,

01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:00.265
you feel you succeeded?

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:01.934
Ah, Mr. Kane.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.545
I think you misunderstand me.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.410
When I began this study,
I was a devout atheist.

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:09.679
I began examining the
gospels as a committed skeptic,

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.912
not as a believer.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.512
You see, I wasn't raised
in a Christian environment,

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.750
although I do think I have
an unusually high regard

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.384
for the value of evidence.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.414
I'm not a Christian because
I was raised that way

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.727
or because I hoped it
would satisfy some need

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.663
or accomplish some goal.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.259
I'm simply a Christian
because it's evidentially true.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.133
Motion to strike, Your Honor.

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.039
Granted.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:39.205
Jury's instructed to ignore
Detective Wallace's last remark.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.249
No further questions.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.114
Witness is excused.

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.982
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:52.857
Mr. Endler, your next witness.

01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:56.124
We don't have one, Your Honor.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.631
She didn't do anything wrong;
she was just trying to help me!

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.465
Brooke!

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:02.128
Order! I'll have order!

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.468
Young lady, your
youth is no excuse

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:07.202
for disturbing the
sanctity of this court.

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:09.311
But this case is
supposed to be about me.

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:10.936
I'm almost 17 years old;

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.490
it's not like I can't
think for myself.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.244
I just don't have
the right to speak.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.494
- Brooke, what are you doing?
- Not unless you are called

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.043
as a witness, young lady.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:20.815
If I put her on the stand,
what am I gonna hear?

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.051
That she asked a
question and I answered it.

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:28.689
Your Honor, we'd like to call
Ms. Brooke Thawley to the stand.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.197
Objection, Your Honor!

01:24:30.299 --> 01:24:31.892
Ms. Thawley is a minor.

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:33.935
Her parents do not
want her subjected

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.537
to the emotional pressure

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:38.106
of testifying against
her own teacher.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.439
Ms. Thawley, are you willing
to testify on your own behalf?

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.807
Yes, Your Honor.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.023
And do you understand

01:24:45.047 --> 01:24:46.208
that you will have to answer

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:47.492
all the questions truthfully,

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:49.348
regardless of your feelings,

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:53.718
and that failure to do
so is punishable by law?

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:55.016
Yes, Your Honor.

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:56.557
I'm not afraid of
telling the truth.

01:24:56.658 --> 01:25:00.060
I'm only afraid of not
being able to tell it.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.905
I will allow this witness.

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:17.877
Objection overruled.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:25.177
Brooke, in class,

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.915
who first brought
up the name "Jesus,"

01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:28.354
you or Ms. Wesley?

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:29.755
I did.

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.291
As part of a question?

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:32.758
Yes.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:34.591
And at that time,

01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:37.495
did you feel like you were
asking a faith-based question?

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.101
No, not really.

01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:41.329
It just seemed like Martin
Luther King and Jesus

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:44.736
were saying similar
things, so I brought it up.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.809
And did you consider
Ms. Wesley's response

01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:49.969
to be a reasonable
answer to your question?

01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:51.705
Yes.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:54.214
So, if I'm hearing
you correctly,

01:25:54.316 --> 01:26:00.256
you asked a question in history
class about a historical figure,

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.654
and your history
teacher answered it

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:03.815
in a sensible manner?

01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:05.928
Yes.

01:26:08.263 --> 01:26:10.892
Thank you.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.195
Your witness.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:26.179
Ms. Thawley, do
you like Ms. Wesley?

01:26:26.314 --> 01:26:27.907
Yes.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.178
Would you say she's
your favorite teacher?

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.014
Yes, absolutely.

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:33.884
Do you think Ms.
Wesley likes you?

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.253
Objection, speculative.

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:39.351
Your Honor, speaks to the
state of mind of the witness,

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.156
if not Ms. Wesley herself.

01:26:41.263 --> 01:26:43.164
I'm gonna allow it. Overruled.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.858
You may answer the question.

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:47.833
Yes, I think she likes me.

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.335
Uh-huh.

01:26:49.471 --> 01:26:50.848
Do you think
there's any possibility

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.501
that in answering your question,

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:58.444
she may have tried to share
some of the ideas of her faith,

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:00.880
a faith that she
holds most dear?

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:03.315
No, uh, no, not at that moment.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:05.478
Not at that moment.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.347
You mean to say that
there were other moments

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:10.483
in which she talked
to you about her faith?

01:27:13.095 --> 01:27:16.497
Hmm? Ms. Thawley, please?

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:19.659
You must answer the
question, Ms. Thawley.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.737
Yes, but it was
outside of school

01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:26.239
and it was only one time.

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:28.434
Move to strike. Your
Honor, this is irrelevant.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.978
No actions off the school
campus are at issue here.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.513
Denied.

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:34.378
Mr. Kane seems to
have found a loose thread.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:36.508
I'm inclined to let him pull it.

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:38.553
See what unravels.

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:39.916
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:41.614
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:45.216
You didn't ask, and I
didn't think it mattered.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.558
Brooke, you realize that
you have to tell the truth here.

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:49.858
You understand that, correct?

01:27:49.965 --> 01:27:51.399
Yes.

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:53.229
So, what did you
mean when you said

01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:58.706
that you had talks about
faith outside of school?

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:06.944
My brother died in an
accident 6 months ago.

01:28:07.082 --> 01:28:09.415
Ms. Wesley noticed
that I wasn't doing so well,

01:28:09.551 --> 01:28:12.453
so she asked me if everything
was all right after class.

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:13.384
Mm-hmm.

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:15.047
I told her I was fine,

01:28:15.157 --> 01:28:18.525
but I went and found her
later on at the coffee shop.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.994
And did Ms. Wesley refer you

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:25.464
to any kind of
psychological counseling?

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.535
No.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:30.299
Did she suggest that perhaps

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:31.565
she wasn't the right person

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:35.075
to be discussing this with you?

01:28:35.177 --> 01:28:36.907
No.

01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:39.072
Well, then what
did Ms. Wesley do?

01:28:39.181 --> 01:28:40.979
She was really nice.

01:28:41.116 --> 01:28:42.607
We talked for a long time

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:45.983
and I could tell that
she really cared.

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:47.749
Mm.

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:49.825
I asked her how she
kept it all together so well,

01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:51.824
and she said, "Jesus."

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.555
So, she's the one
who brought up Jesus?

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:56.757
Did her endorsement of Jesus

01:28:56.865 --> 01:28:59.391
move you to
explore Christianity?

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:01.197
Yes, at first.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:06.673
But when the Salvation Army
came to pick up my brother's things,

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:12.679
one of the ladies found his
Bible, and she gave it to me.

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:14.908
I didn't even know
that he had one.

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.450
Mm.

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:19.988
So, I started reading
it, and once I started,

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:25.287
I realized that I
didn't wanna stop.

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.157
That's why.

01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:30.892
That's why I came up with the
question that I asked in class.

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:33.627
Now, if I understand
you correctly,

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:37.137
without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement,

01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:39.640
you never would've asked
that question in the first place,

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:41.676
would you?

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:43.335
I don't know.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:47.006
After all of your
Bible readings,

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:52.849
do you feel now that
you're a believer?

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:54.854
Yes.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:30:00.725
Maybe even a Christian?

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:04.196
Yes.

01:30:04.299 --> 01:30:06.393
At the risk of
seeming redundant,

01:30:06.534 --> 01:30:09.060
do you think any of
this, the Bible readings,

01:30:09.204 --> 01:30:13.005
the question about
Jesus in class,

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:15.668
the newfound
commitment to Christianity,

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:19.179
is it likely that any of
that would've occurred

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:24.310
without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement?

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:28.720
No, it wouldn't.

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:32.259
I thank you for your honesty.

01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:34.761
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:38.196
Mr. Endler, do you
wish to redirect?

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.769
No, Your Honor.

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:43.770
You may step down, Ms. Thawley.

01:30:58.153 --> 01:31:00.452
Why do they look so angry?

01:31:00.588 --> 01:31:02.420
Because they think
we lied to them.

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:05.823
But we didn't.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:08.487
It doesn't matter.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.724
This court is adjourned.

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:20.136
I have to prepare you, Grace.

01:31:20.275 --> 01:31:24.906
We're gonna lose this case.

01:31:25.013 --> 01:31:27.915
I know.

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:30.144
You were right.

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:35.383
I'm gonna lose everything.

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.219
We saw a very
large crowd out here

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:56.802
at the courthouse yesterday,

01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:59.881
both in protest and support
of teacher Grace Wesley,

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:03.417
who is on trial for allegedly
proselytizing at the classroom.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:05.180
Now, in an unexpected
move yesterday,

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.948
we saw some of
Wesley's former students

01:32:07.055 --> 01:32:11.686
come out to silently demonstrate
their support for their teacher.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.972
Oh Father, please
take this from me.

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:38.486
I don't know what to do.

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:42.353
Please don't forsake me.

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:45.392
Please.

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:13.311
Hey, Brooke.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.686
I ruined everything, didn't I?

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.191
It's okay, you don't
have to answer.

01:33:18.293 --> 01:33:20.819
I know that I did.

01:33:20.929 --> 01:33:23.398
I'm not even
allowed to talk to her.

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.159
How do I let her
know that I'm sorry

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.666
without making things worse?

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.930
I can't tell you what to do,

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:35.374
but whatever you do,
just let her know you care.

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:41.709
Recently, when
I've been praying,

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:44.411
it's like Jesus isn't letting
me feel his presence.

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:47.249
Usually I can almost
reach out and touch him,

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:55.388
but right now it's like
he's a million miles away.

01:33:55.597 --> 01:34:00.058
Honey, you of all
people should realize

01:34:00.168 --> 01:34:02.899
when you're going through
something really hard,

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:08.307
the teacher is always
quiet during the test.

First of all,

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:06.655
this trial took an
unexpected turn

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.390
when Wesley's counsel
decided they'd try to prove

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:12.090
the existence of Jesus.

01:36:12.233 --> 01:36:14.395
Gary, this is kind of
your area of expertise.

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:16.937
How do you
convince the skeptics?

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:20.940
Well, Governor, I employ what
I call the minimal facts method,

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:23.476
which uses only
the historical events

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:25.375
that are so well evidenced

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.449
that they're accepted
across the board,

01:36:27.582 --> 01:36:30.575
even by skeptical and
non-Christian scholars.

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:31.845
As a result, we...

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:33.251
Now I understand what it is

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:35.289
you weren't
allowed to talk about.

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:38.882
I wish I still wasn't
allowed to talk about it.

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:41.292
She needs me on that jury.

01:36:41.429 --> 01:36:42.897
Have faith, David.

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.932
God's plan is at work.

01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:46.864
How'd you get here anyway?

01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:47.978
I borrowed your Prius.

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:49.527
It's very nice.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.748
Don't get too comfortable.

01:36:50.772 --> 01:36:52.741
I'm planning a full recovery.

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.240
So, Rice, do you believe

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:55.653
that she was proselytizing
to her students?

01:36:55.677 --> 01:36:57.077
Governor, not at all.

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:59.443
Jesus Christ was the
most influential person

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.106
who ever lived.

01:37:01.249 --> 01:37:03.169
How could you ignore
that fact and teach history?

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:05.651
I think the real problem is...

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:07.415
Hey, Martin!

01:37:07.522 --> 01:37:08.888
More questions?

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:10.501
I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

01:37:10.525 --> 01:37:12.118
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:14.104
They're just holding me
over for a little observation.

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.563
I'll be released soon.

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.257
Something different about you.

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:19.766
Are you okay?

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.460
I should say so.

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.594
Yes.

01:37:23.705 --> 01:37:25.469
I believe God wants
me to be a minister,

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.734
to return to my country
and become a pastor,

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.105
just like you.

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.678
That's great.

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:32.940
There'll be challenges
in your country.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:35.516
Are you prepared for them?

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:38.987
I am.

01:37:41.122 --> 01:37:42.522
I'm proud of you.

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:44.023
Come here.

01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:48.728
That's awesome.

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:50.274
It's a shocking reality

01:37:50.298 --> 01:37:51.675
that Christians are
soon gonna be forced

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.565
to choose between
obeying the law of man

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.932
or following the Word of God.

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:57.505
I'm Mike Huckabee.

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:59.368
We'll see you next
time on "Point of View."

01:38:27.869 --> 01:38:29.380
Hey Brooke, why don't
you go be with Ms. Wesley.

01:38:29.404 --> 01:38:31.202
I think we can handle this.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.283
Yeah, seriously, we've
got backup coming.

01:38:33.307 --> 01:38:36.175
You're covered.

01:38:38.513 --> 01:38:40.072
Go get 'em.

01:38:44.786 --> 01:38:47.312
God's got this.

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:18.916
Where's Tom?

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:26.884
All rise.

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:35.896
Be seated.

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.644
Are we missing someone?

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.945
Sorry, Your Honor.

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.917
My apologies to the court.

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:59.191
That's unexpected.

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.489
He almost looks like a lawyer.

01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:06.124
Your Honor, I have
one final witness to call.

01:40:06.267 --> 01:40:09.362
Grace Wesley.

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.063
Ms. Wesley, please

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.471
approach the witness stand.

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:15.475
Do I have to?

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:17.579
I'm afraid so.

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:24.812
Your Honor, given the
witness's reluctance to testify,

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.730
can I have the court's
permission to treat her

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.086
as a hostile witness?

01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:32.524
You may. Proceed
at your own peril.

01:40:35.663 --> 01:40:37.841
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:38.958
and nothing but the truth?

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.159
I do.

01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:41.667
Please be seated.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.473
Grace, I want you to
do something for me,

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:52.308
something for everyone
in this courtroom.

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:54.507
I want you to apologize.

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:57.380
I want you to say you're sorry
and that you made a mistake.

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:58.798
Your Honor, what's
going on here?

01:40:58.853 --> 01:41:01.220
Do it, Grace.

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:02.846
I can't do that.

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:04.892
Why? Why can't
you do that, Grace?

01:41:05.026 --> 01:41:07.518
Because I don't believe
I did anything wrong.

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:11.156
Well, as your attorney, I'm
advising you to do it anyway.

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:12.995
To at least pretend
that you're sorry

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.399
and throw yourself on
the mercy of the court.

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:16.560
What?

01:41:16.704 --> 01:41:18.070
That would be a lie.

01:41:18.205 --> 01:41:19.503
So what?

01:41:19.607 --> 01:41:20.939
Everyone lies.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:22.509
Not everyone.

01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:25.079
Are you looking to
become a martyr?

01:41:25.212 --> 01:41:27.044
What in the world is he doing?

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:28.706
I have no idea.

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:29.816
No.

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.216
Tommy...

01:41:31.352 --> 01:41:33.048
Then what is it that
you want, Grace?

01:41:33.154 --> 01:41:36.352
Tell me. Tell us.

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:37.857
I want...

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:42.897
I want to be able
to tell the truth.

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:45.431
The truth?

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:46.898
Whose truth?

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:50.527
And what truth are
you referring to?

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:55.406
Grace, is there some truth that
you know that no one else knows?

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:58.877
Oh, that's right.

01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.573
The other night,

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:04.243
didn't you tell me that Jesus
spoke to you personally?

01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:05.843
Why are you doing this?

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.564
I'm the one asking the
questions, Ms. Wesley.

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.079
Did you or did you not tell me

01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:13.252
that Jesus spoke
to you personally?

01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:15.796
Yes.

01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:18.229
And what did he say?

01:42:18.332 --> 01:42:20.096
I'll make it easier for you.

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:22.794
Didn't you say that he
asked you a question?

01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:24.648
That was personal. You
weren't supposed to...

01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:26.300
I don't care.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.619
The other night, you told me
that Jesus asked you something.

01:42:28.643 --> 01:42:30.271
What did he ask you, Grace?

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:31.812
Tell all of us.

01:42:31.946 --> 01:42:33.312
I think we deserve to know.

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.040
Why are you doing this to me?

01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.549
Answer the question.

01:42:36.651 --> 01:42:38.210
They won't believe me.

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:40.254
Doesn't matter.

01:42:40.354 --> 01:42:45.452
All that matters is
that you believe it.

01:42:45.593 --> 01:42:48.722
Tell us, Grace, under
penalty of perjury,

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:51.765
what was the question that
God presented to you personally

01:42:51.866 --> 01:42:55.325
that night on campus?

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:57.802
Answer the question.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.102
Answer the question!

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:15.284
He asked, "Who do
you say that I am?"

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:21.954
And what did you answer?

01:43:22.063 --> 01:43:27.263
You are the Christ, the
Son of the living God.

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:33.868
Well, there you have it.

01:43:34.008 --> 01:43:36.876
Your Honor, I think we've
all heard quite enough.

01:43:37.011 --> 01:43:38.445
Mr. Endler,

01:43:38.546 --> 01:43:40.879
are you looking to
change your client's plea?

01:43:41.015 --> 01:43:42.813
No, Your Honor.

01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:45.045
I say she's innocent
of all wrongdoing.

01:43:45.186 --> 01:43:48.384
But I'm asking the jury to
find against her anyway.

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:50.184
I mean, let's, let's face it.

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:54.284
She has the audacity to believe
not only that there is a God,

01:43:54.395 --> 01:43:56.830
but that she has a personal
relationship with Him,

01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:00.368
which colors everything
that she says and does.

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:02.068
I think it's time that
we stop pretending

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:04.163
that we can trust
a person like this

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.331
to serve in a public capacity.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.899
In the name of tolerance and
diversity, I say we destroy her.

01:44:10.044 --> 01:44:11.421
That's enough, Mr. Endler.

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:13.175
Then we can all go
to our graves content,

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.340
knowing that we stomped
out the last spark of faith

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:17.209
that was ever exhibited
in the public square.

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.696
That's enough, Mr. Endler.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.764
I say we make an example of her.

01:44:20.788 --> 01:44:22.586
Mr. Endler, that's enough.

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.214
Let's set a new precedent,

01:44:24.325 --> 01:44:26.954
that employment by our
federal government mandates

01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:29.723
that you must first denounce
any belief system you have.

01:44:29.864 --> 01:44:31.608
Mr. Endler that is enough!
You are out of order.

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:33.362
And if someone slips
through the cracks

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:37.768
and hides their beliefs, then
we arrest them and fine them.

01:44:37.905 --> 01:44:39.883
And if they don't pay,
then we seize their property.

01:44:39.907 --> 01:44:41.205
And if they resist...

01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:44.042
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

01:44:44.145 --> 01:44:46.011
Enforcement is always
at the end of a gun.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:47.958
Mr. Endler, you
are out of order.

01:44:47.982 --> 01:44:49.314
I charge you with contempt!

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:51.078
I accept the charge,

01:44:51.218 --> 01:44:53.744
because I have nothing but
contempt for these proceedings.

01:44:53.888 --> 01:44:56.756
If we're going to insist that
a Christian's right to believe

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.689
is subordinate
to all other rights,

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:00.955
then it's not a right.

01:45:01.095 --> 01:45:03.690
Somebody is always
going to be offended.

01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:06.666
Two thousand years of
human history proves that.

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:08.463
So, I say we get on with it.

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:11.936
Cite the law, charge the jury,
and send them off to deliberate.

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:14.031
So be it!

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:21.440
Now, we are gonna bypass
the usual closing arguments,

01:45:21.549 --> 01:45:24.951
unless Mr. Kane finds the
need to further address the jury.

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:26.951
No, Your Honor.

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.386
We can ask nothing more.

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:33.393
My Instructions
to you are simple.

01:45:33.494 --> 01:45:37.795
Uphold the law without
unfairly prejudicing your decision

01:45:37.932 --> 01:45:42.495
or risking a mistrial on appeal.

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:48.507
Now, I believe I can safely say
that the respondent's counsel

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:53.740
has dared you to
convict his own client.

01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:01.486
The jury will now be
dismissed for deliberation.

01:46:01.622 --> 01:46:04.751
We are adjourned.

01:46:11.065 --> 01:46:13.432
She hasn't got a prayer.

01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:14.832
Let's go.

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.902
Remind me to send
him a thank-you note.

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.271
Thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.

01:47:28.409 --> 01:47:29.741
Thanks for coming out.

01:47:29.877 --> 01:47:31.778
Hey, right now on the phone,

01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:33.904
a friend of mine named
Amy is on the line,

01:47:34.048 --> 01:47:38.611
and she's calling about a
woman who's on trial for her faith.

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:43.156
This woman has risked
everything for Jesus.

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.816
Amy's asked me to
pray for this woman.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.929
Will you guys join me?

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:51.226
Lord, we know that
to risk anything for you

01:47:51.332 --> 01:47:55.463
is a complete honor
with eternal rewards.

01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:57.571
But if it's within your will,

01:47:57.671 --> 01:48:01.802
can you please restore
this woman's hope

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:07.108
and make her faith
an example to all of us?

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:10.376
Lord, show your
power to a fallen world.

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:15.320
We know you have the
power to do anything.

01:48:15.456 --> 01:48:19.325
So, we ask you right now,
crying out as the body of Christ,

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.258
move those hearts
of those people,

01:48:21.362 --> 01:48:23.331
both the judge and the jury,

01:48:23.464 --> 01:48:27.834
to let them know the
beauty of your majesty.

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:31.837
And we all said amen.

01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:33.235
Amen.

01:49:04.571 --> 01:49:06.282
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:08.275
have you reached a decision?

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.645
We have, Your Honor.

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:18.985
And how do you find?

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:30.227
We, the jury, find in
favor of Grace Wesley.

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:50.517
We are adjourned.

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:03.493
Nice shoes.

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:28.613
Grace, I'm sorry.

01:50:28.755 --> 01:50:29.779
I couldn't tell you.

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.687
It had to come as a surprise,

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:34.455
otherwise the jury wouldn't have
been swayed by your reactions.

01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:38.396
So, you did have a plan.

01:50:38.499 --> 01:50:41.958
No, you did.

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:43.627
You stood up for
what you believed in

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:45.705
and you held on to your faith.

01:50:45.806 --> 01:50:48.970
I don't know anybody
that would have done that.

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:51.738
They were hoping to
make an example of you,

01:50:51.845 --> 01:50:57.944
but instead you
became an inspiration.

01:50:58.085 --> 01:51:00.054
We did it!

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:03.249
Hey, you've kept
quiet long enough.

01:51:03.357 --> 01:51:06.759
Why don't you go
share the good news?

01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:14.992
Hey, thank you.

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:17.434

for Ms. Grace Wesley.

01:52:39.553 --> 01:52:41.522

In the case of
Thawley v. Wesley,

01:52:52.032 --> 01:52:53.898
they have ruled in
favor of Grace Wesley.

01:52:54.034 --> 01:52:56.902
The crowd is in full celebration
here in Hope Springs.

01:52:57.004 --> 01:53:00.236
So are you gonna
say it, or should I?

Don't bother.

01:53:46.086 --> 01:53:47.349
He outsmarted us.

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:50.924
He played our role
in attacking Wesley.

01:53:51.024 --> 01:53:53.459
He made the jury
hate everyone, but her.

01:53:53.593 --> 01:53:58.122
Not to mention he proved
the existence of Jesus Christ.

01:59:19.853 --> 01:59:22.254
Two days of ice
chips. I'm starving.

01:59:23.657 --> 01:59:25.057
I'm hungry as well, David.

01:59:25.158 --> 01:59:27.627
How about I take you
for a nice tuna melt?

01:59:27.761 --> 01:59:29.423
David Hill?

01:59:29.529 --> 01:59:32.294
Yes?

01:59:32.432 --> 01:59:34.594
You're under arrest.

01:59:34.701 --> 01:59:35.760
For what?

01:59:35.869 --> 01:59:37.462
Contempt of court.

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:39.644
You failed to produce your
sermons upon court order.

01:59:39.673 --> 01:59:41.183
Please put your hands
behind your back.

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:42.607
Please be gentle.

01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:44.439
He has just been
released from the hospital.

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:45.568
I don't understand.

01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:47.272
What is he being accused of?

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.158
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:51.102
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:53.483
in a court of law. You
have a right to an attorney.

01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:54.664
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

01:59:54.688 --> 01:59:56.156
one will be provided for you.

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:58.369
Do you understand the
rights I have just read to you?

01:59:58.491 --> 01:59:59.857
Yes.

02:00:07.067 --> 02:00:08.558
Sorry about this, Pastor.

02:00:08.702 --> 02:00:10.671
It's okay.

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:11.981
Looks like I'm gonna
need you to fill in for me

02:00:12.005 --> 02:00:13.303
a little while longer.

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:16.035
Of course, David,
anything you need.

02:00:21.347 --> 02:00:22.645
What do we do now?

02:00:22.749 --> 02:00:24.377
Same as always, Martin.

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:28.648
We pray, in faith.
