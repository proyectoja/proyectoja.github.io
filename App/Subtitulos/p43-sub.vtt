<i>It is not ours by way of inheritance.</i>

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:48.446
<i>It must be fought for and defended
constantly by each generation...</i>

-How much have you saved?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.765
Okay, well, if I sell my guitar,

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.487
I can probably get a
couple hundred extra bucks.

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.449
Yeah, it's too expensive.

-Have you had breakfast yet?
-(CHUCKLES)

00:02:39.453 --> 00:02:42.433

I'm gonna have to pull a double tonight.

-(SPOUSE SIGHS) I'm sorry.
-It doesn't happen often.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.487
Anyway, Jackson's babysitter
will pick him up tonight.

00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:48.497
Do you remember Miss Meredith,
the church secretary?

00:02:49.404 --> 00:02:50.464
Taylor, it's gonna be fine.

about your mission trip.

-Was it amazing?
-Oh, you would love China.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:13.400
She's my native country,
but I don't think I can return.

00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:14.426
Why?

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:18.410
The persecution of people of faith
is much worse now than when I left.

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.424
And not just of Christians
but of Uyghur Muslims and others.

00:03:22.488 --> 00:03:26.411
Yeah, I heard they're trying
to detain millions in reeducation camps.

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:28.458
Now they're trying
to contextualize the Bible

00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:31.438
to make it more culturally appropriate.

00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.485
Freedom is fragile, Ayisha.

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:37.402
Did you see your family?

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:41.439
I traveled to the other side of the world.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.486
They still won't speak to me
now that I'm a Christian.

00:03:44.493 --> 00:03:47.477
My family lives down the street,
and my father won't talk to me.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.460
I didn't think
that Christianity could be so...

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:52.460

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.491

MR. HILL: How's Jackson doing?

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:36.408
He's coming out of his shell a little bit.
He relaxes around Shannon, so that's good.

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:37.498
Yeah. That is good.

00:04:38.462 --> 00:04:40.402
How about Taylor?

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:41.478
She's been at the church for six months

00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:44.442
and I just realized that I don't know
anything about her.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.498
I guess that's my fault.

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.400
No, don't beat yourself up.
She keeps to herself.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.479
Usually works nights so she can be
with Jackson during the day.

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:53.466
I didn't know that.

00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:57.414
Still, it's my job to let people know
they have a home at St. Jude's.

00:04:57.477 --> 00:04:59.450
All right, everyone.

for some reading time.

to this story than just rain.

00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:33.487
How do you think people reacted to Noah

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.467
when he suddenly started
to build a big boat?

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:37.430
-They probably thought he was nuts.

MR. HILL: I think you may be right.
And that's the point.

00:05:40.418 --> 00:05:43.415
Sometimes trusting God
means believing and doing things

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:45.405
that the world won't understand.

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:48.449

our obedience to him.

you aren't missing anything.

It's not short for anything.
It's complete by itself.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.453
She meant no disrespect.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.459
She's just asking
if you're single or married

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.447
so she might address you properly.

00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:39.481

to find a more appropriate book.

Sure.

Noah did everything
as God commanded him."

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:37.493

from the Noah myth, is obey God or die?

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:41.453

that's one way to look at it.

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:30.449
Growing up,
we always heard that in America

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:33.473
you could say whatever you please,
wear whatever you like

00:11:33.483 --> 00:11:35.427
and worship whomever you will.

00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:37.467
And that's still true, Ayisha.

00:11:37.474 --> 00:11:40.444
This is just a misunderstanding.
It has to be.

00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:43.444
Yes, the Supreme Court
said we can worship God

00:11:43.454 --> 00:11:45.467
according to the dictates
of our own conscience.

00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:48.408
It's how the court defines liberty.

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:50.484
How do you know so much
about the Constitution?

00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:53.455
I studied for the civics test
to get my citizenship.

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:55.461
American history is a hobby for me now.

00:11:55.472 --> 00:11:56.471
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:11:56.479 --> 00:11:58.492
The Constitution is an amazing document.

00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:02.412
Ah. Yup, I suppose it is.

00:12:02.423 --> 00:12:03.429
(AYISHA CHUCKLES)

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.457
Uh, hi, excuse me.
Are you selling your car?

00:12:13.464 --> 00:12:15.497
Sure am. You buying?

00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.447
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, well, maybe.

00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:20.438
Um...

00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:22.441
-I'm Brandon.
-Kayla.

00:12:23.425 --> 00:12:24.488
So, like what you see?

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.458
Huh?

00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:28.438
The car.

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:33.409
(CHUCKLES) Yes. Yeah.
Um, she's very beautiful.

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:35.415
-(CHUCKLES)
-It's beautiful.

00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:36.479
-The car, I was talking about.
-Uh-huh.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.449
-Right.
-This is just temporary right now.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.447
-May I ask why you're selling it?
-I start college in the fall.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:44.463
It's too expensive to have a car on campus.

00:12:44.474 --> 00:12:46.476
Totally, college. Yeah.

00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:50.428
Well, it'd be great
if I could get some pictures or...

00:12:51.498 --> 00:12:54.431
Uh, yeah. Brandon.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.441
-Kayla.
-Yeah.

00:12:55.448 --> 00:12:57.411
-I already asked you.
-Yup. (CHUCKLES)

00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.431
Sorry.

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:14.450
It all seems so extreme.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.400
Dave, I want you to know that we will not
be cooperating at all, okay?

00:13:18.411 --> 00:13:20.480
-Yeah. Not giving in is more like it.
-MIKE: Yeah.

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:22.484
I've spoken to the board.

00:13:22.494 --> 00:13:26.414
We could certainly adjust the curriculum
to be more accommodating.

00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:29.484
Don't you mean compromise the curriculum?
We already told them we're not conforming.

00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:32.415
Religion has been removed
from our schools.

00:13:32.422 --> 00:13:35.402
They're teaching kids
that they don't need God.

00:13:35.469 --> 00:13:38.445
That faith is irrelevant
to their personal choices, Dave.

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:39.479
DAVID: I hear you.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.456
I mean, these are some of the reasons
we started the co-op in the first place.

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:43.465
It's just...

00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:46.483
I need you to understand

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.406
what you're getting yourself into
when you fight City Hall.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.480
DAVID:<i> The church really should've
moved off-campus 50 years ago...</i>

00:13:51.487 --> 00:13:54.440
<i>Court costs, attorney fees.</i>

00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:56.431
Communities become divided.

00:13:56.438 --> 00:13:58.485
<i>A beacon of violence and controversy,</i>

00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:02.435

-You're under arrest.

<i>...at Hadley University campus.</i>

00:14:10.422 --> 00:14:13.475
It's a time-consuming, draining experience

00:14:14.466 --> 00:14:16.489
that rarely ends
the way that you had hoped.

00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:20.486

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:24.456

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:26.473
DAVID: Let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

00:14:27.427 --> 00:14:29.440
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

00:14:31.451 --> 00:14:33.461
MS. DOWD:
During our observed instruction,

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.444
a number of deficiencies were noted.

00:14:35.455 --> 00:14:39.425
These include: one,
lack of instructional effectiveness,

00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:43.476
two, an environment inferior
to a group-learning experience,

00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:48.445
three, the parents' inability
to cover all intellectual areas,

00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:51.469
and four, the absence of
sufficient equipment,

00:14:51.477 --> 00:14:53.453
especially in the sciences.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.426
We are concerned that these children
may not acquire the essential skills

00:14:57.437 --> 00:15:00.403
for good citizenship
and for their learning.

00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:02.480
{\an8}Has there been some attempt
at upgrading the curriculum?

00:15:02.491 --> 00:15:04.428
{\an8}There has, Your Honor.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:05.471
{\an8}But the parents in the St. Jude co-op

00:15:05.478 --> 00:15:09.455
have refused to conform their curriculum
with district norms.

00:15:09.462 --> 00:15:10.478
Is this true?

00:15:10.488 --> 00:15:13.475
Yes, Your Honor,
but you need to understand--

00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:16.455
A simple "yes" or "no"
would answer the question.

00:15:16.462 --> 00:15:18.496
If you say "yes," that's a problem.

00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:21.405
Does the district have a recommendation?

00:15:21.413 --> 00:15:22.462
We recommend the children be returned

00:15:22.473 --> 00:15:24.496
to an accredited learning program
immediately.

00:15:25.407 --> 00:15:26.450
(CLEARS THROAT) Your Honor,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.497
the district is complaining
about the lack of socialization.

00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:30.459
But our children
are being denied the chance

00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:33.490
to participate in any kind of
extracurricular activities--

00:15:33.497 --> 00:15:34.496
State law is clear.

00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:38.474
Homeschoolers have no right
to exploit extracurricular activities

00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:40.447
at a school they don't see fit to attend.

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:42.468
It's an either/or situation, Mr. McKinnon.

00:15:42.478 --> 00:15:45.445
The children in your co-op
cannot ask for dessert

00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:47.432
without eating their dinner first.

00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:49.445
DAVID: Their parents
pay taxes though, right?

00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.435
Excuse me?

00:15:51.446 --> 00:15:53.445
I mean, their property taxes.

00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:57.420
That would cover the dessert
and the dinner too, correct?

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.482
-And you are?
-Reverend David Hill, Your Honor.

00:15:59.493 --> 00:16:01.493
It was our church
that organized the co-op.

00:16:02.487 --> 00:16:05.410
I remember you well, Pastor.

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:08.447
I do not pretend to be
an educational professional,

00:16:08.454 --> 00:16:11.471
and I also note, however,
that neither are any of you.

00:16:12.448 --> 00:16:14.454
This case could take years to settle,

00:16:14.465 --> 00:16:16.481
and your children simply
can't wait that long.

00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:19.455
In the interim,
I am going to sign an order

00:16:19.465 --> 00:16:22.418
giving you ten days to either conform

00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:24.482
to the district supervisor's recommendation

00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:28.406
or enroll your children
in accredited schools.

00:16:28.473 --> 00:16:30.432
And if we refuse?

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:32.469
(SIGHS)

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.456
Parents have the freedom
to raise their children

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:38.480
in line with their moral
and religious beliefs.

00:16:38.487 --> 00:16:42.450
Your children, however,
enjoy the right to an education.

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:47.488
Your freedoms as parents do not
supersede your children's rights.

00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:49.468
Your Honor, please--

00:16:49.475 --> 00:16:52.481
Your beliefs do not exempt you
from the law, Mr. McKinnon.

00:16:52.489 --> 00:16:56.476
Therefore, if your children do not show up
at school a week from Monday,

00:16:56.486 --> 00:17:00.459
you will be fined $1,000 a day
for the first two weeks.

00:17:00.469 --> 00:17:04.406
Thereafter, you will be charged
with contempt of court,

00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:05.493
meaning you will be incarcerated.

00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:07.440
During which time

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.487
the court will appoint temporary custody
of your children

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:14.440
to someone who will abide
by the court's decision.

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:17.441
Perhaps the good reverend
can explain further

00:17:17.451 --> 00:17:20.488
the ramifications of contempt
in this courtroom.

00:17:21.468 --> 00:17:22.484

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:32.496

Certainly, Pastor David.

-Okay.
-What's the topic?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.446
Topic is, "What does faith look like?"

00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:53.401
It's so hard to nail it down.

00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:55.477
(CHUCKLES) Yes, because it's relative.

00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:00.421
In Nigeria, many of the people
that were ministered to

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.487
are only ever a moment away from death.

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:07.495
Death from hunger, disease, bad water.

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:11.465
Villagers walk to church, many for hours.

00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:15.416
They don't say,
Oh, I have to go to church today.

00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:20.406
They say, "Yes, it's Sunday.
I get to go to church."

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:23.404
In the backcountry,
people don't have money.

00:19:23.484 --> 00:19:27.437
They bring carrots, eggs, milk.

00:19:27.447 --> 00:19:28.497
It's all they have.

00:19:29.498 --> 00:19:31.434
It's their widow's mite.

00:19:32.405 --> 00:19:36.492
They're happy to give the Lord thanks
for one more week of life.

00:19:37.458 --> 00:19:40.414
So when somebody
puts a gun on their heads and says,

00:19:40.422 --> 00:19:41.498
Denounce Jesus and die,

00:19:42.492 --> 00:19:46.426
they say, "Jesus, I'm coming home to you."

00:19:47.469 --> 00:19:51.483
That's what faith looks like
for those who have nothing,

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:57.470
who are so close to death every day
and still have that fire and love for God.

00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:02.484
You humble me, Jude.

00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:03.493

00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:00.495
and help with any court costs
and attorney fees if need be.

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.433
Dave, the church doesn't have
those kinds of funds.

00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:07.486
We have eight days to figure it out.

00:22:09.404 --> 00:22:10.430
And I...

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:15.454
I will personally cover the cost
of any fines if we have to.

00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:17.883
David, unless you won the lottery,

00:22:17.907 --> 00:22:20.421
there's no way you'll
be able to pay for all this.

00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:22.404
Unless you're betting you won't have to.

00:22:22.415 --> 00:22:24.474
I have faith that I won't have to.

00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:27.472
And if I do, I'll deal with it then.

00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:29.408
This is important.

00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:31.442
Why the change of heart?

00:22:31.452 --> 00:22:33.449
(CHUCKLES)

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:39.419
An old friend reminded me
that our freedoms came with a price.

00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:42.420
China banned homeschooling

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:46.476
because homeschool students are not
exposed to state-sponsored indoctrination.

00:22:46.487 --> 00:22:47.486
Mmm.

00:22:47.494 --> 00:22:51.474
If any parent chooses to homeschool,
they must do so underground

00:22:51.485 --> 00:22:53.421
and at great risk.

00:22:53.485 --> 00:22:58.401
Once a freedom is taken away,
it is very difficult to get it back.

00:22:58.408 --> 00:22:59.407
DAVID: Exactly.

00:22:59.419 --> 00:23:02.471
And to that end,
I think we might have a little help.

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:07.412
Earlier, I got a phone call from
Daryl Smith, a congressman from Texas.

00:23:07.423 --> 00:23:08.422
Congressman?

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.459
Mr. Smith told me
Congress is meeting next week,

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.479
and they're having hearings on education.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.430
They asked if any of us would go
to Washington and describe our situation.

00:23:18.474 --> 00:23:20.404
Washington, DC?

00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:22.407
Washington, DC.

00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:23.470
-You okay?
-Yeah.

00:23:28.478 --> 00:23:30.422
Hey, son, make sure to help Grandma.

00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:31.477
It's only gonna be a couple nights,
I promise.

00:23:31.489 --> 00:23:33.408
Yeah, sure.

00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:36.488
Hey, Dad, I know with everything going on,
money might be tight,

00:23:36.496 --> 00:23:38.498
especially if you guys have to pay fines.

00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:41.425
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna work this out.

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:42.459
What's this?

00:23:42.466 --> 00:23:45.450
Well, just in case,
I want you to take the money for the car.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.433
It's not gonna kill me
to ride a bike a little while longer.

00:23:48.444 --> 00:23:50.443
You're gonna make me cry now, okay? No.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.466
Me and your mother
are gonna work this thing out, I promise.

00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:55.474
But you know,
I want you to know something, okay?

00:23:55.481 --> 00:23:59.430
I couldn't be any more proud
than I am of you right now, son.

00:23:59.441 --> 00:24:00.440
(CHUCKLES)

00:24:00.448 --> 00:24:02.424
-I love you, man.
-Yeah, I love you.

00:24:03.428 --> 00:24:04.475
All right, don't cry. Don't cry.

00:24:04.482 --> 00:24:08.431
Be good for Grandma, do whatever she says,
and no arguing over bedtime, okay?

00:24:08.442 --> 00:24:09.486
Mom, really?

00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:11.432
I got this.

00:24:11.442 --> 00:24:13.436
You too big to give your mom a hug?

00:24:14.476 --> 00:24:17.436

What's wrong, honey?
Is it Jackson?

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.404
He's with Miss Meredith.

00:24:31.471 --> 00:24:32.484
It's worth it, right?

00:24:32.495 --> 00:24:34.461
-Our kids?
-Of course it is.

00:24:34.468 --> 00:24:37.481
-Taylor, what's the matter?
-We should go. We can't miss our plane.

00:24:40.422 --> 00:24:42.495
DAVID: I really appreciate you
coming along and keeping me company.

00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:46.429
Did you know that two presidents
kept alligators at the White House?

00:24:46.436 --> 00:24:48.473
It's just sometimes
I feel a little out of place

00:24:48.483 --> 00:24:50.446
being the only non-parent in the group.

00:24:50.453 --> 00:24:51.455
No way.

00:24:51.466 --> 00:24:52.486
I know, it's silly, but--

00:24:52.497 --> 00:24:56.463
There's a statue of Darth Vader's head
on top of the National Cathedral.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.423
-What?
-What?

00:24:59.437 --> 00:25:02.454
Oh, thanks for letting me come along.
It means a lot to me.

00:25:02.464 --> 00:25:04.484
Ah, don't mention it.

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:17.405
Hey, what do you think of this car?

00:25:19.426 --> 00:25:21.406
That's freedom right there.

00:25:21.416 --> 00:25:23.415
It's a chance to hang
with people my own age.

00:25:23.423 --> 00:25:24.436
What car?

00:25:24.443 --> 00:25:26.426
I see some girl, and...

00:25:26.437 --> 00:25:27.493
Oh, wait, there it is.

00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:29.426

00:25:29.437 --> 00:25:31.417
You're so funny. Yeah.

00:25:31.424 --> 00:25:33.421
What do you know?
You're just a fifth-grader.

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:37.473
I know Mom and Dad will be mad
if you waste your money on the wrong car.

00:25:37.484 --> 00:25:39.451

with the car.

No, um, thank you.

00:25:52.409 --> 00:25:56.486
I can finally give the bike to my sister
and travel in style.

If it's a good car?

00:26:23.422 --> 00:26:24.421
Yeah.

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:27.462

Uh, guys, I don't think
Taylor's gonna wanna do any sightseeing.

00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:52.407
On the flight over here, she told us
that she was released from her job.

00:28:52.457 --> 00:28:53.456
Why?

00:28:53.464 --> 00:28:57.463
Guess she's been taking too much time off,
and the trip to DC certainly didn't help.

to sit here and hold my hand.

that's okay.

want her parents going to jail.

to worry about things like that.

00:29:58.454 --> 00:30:00.467

She even asked to sleep in our bed.

00:30:00.477 --> 00:30:02.480

in over a year.

an Air Force training mission,

long enough to read between the lines.

because I know why he did.

very well, you know?

in the fall for a fresh start.

you've all been lifesavers.

I don't know what my son and I
would do without you.

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:04.456
Jackson wouldn't last ten minutes
in a public school.

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:08.487
They'd classify him as "special education"
and label him "emotionally disturbed."

00:31:10.404 --> 00:31:12.410
They'd give him
an individual education plan

00:31:12.421 --> 00:31:14.404
which might not even challenge him at all,

00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:17.471
until eventually Jackson becomes
the label the state pins on him,

00:31:17.478 --> 00:31:21.488
and why his father died,
I feel like, would all be for nothing.

that you went to Oakwood.

00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:10.425

00:34:10.436 --> 00:34:13.412
No, my sister and I have been
homeschooled since the start.

00:34:13.423 --> 00:34:14.475
KAYLA: What's that like?

00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:16.489
Well, the lunches are better,

00:34:16.496 --> 00:34:19.409

to go to the bathroom,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.426

00:34:22.444 --> 00:34:25.430
No, there's no pressure
to be popular, I guess.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.427
No bullies, no school lockdowns.

00:34:28.437 --> 00:34:32.444
But I don't know, I guess the best part
is I just get to be myself, you know?

00:34:33.465 --> 00:34:36.495
My thoughts are my own,
not what I memorized.

00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:40.488
Yeah, I learn stuff
and make it matter to me.

00:34:42.425 --> 00:34:43.431
Wow.

00:34:43.442 --> 00:34:44.462
I mean, it's not all that.

00:34:44.472 --> 00:34:47.466
I don't get to do, you know, this.

00:34:48.433 --> 00:34:53.427
(CHUCKLES) No school sports,
no homecoming, no prom.

00:34:53.433 --> 00:34:56.456
I really don't get to meet a lot of people
outside church, so, you know...

00:34:56.464 --> 00:34:57.497
You're not really missing much.

00:34:58.407 --> 00:35:00.477
Nobody goes to the homecoming dances,
'cause everyone thinks they're lame.

00:35:00.484 --> 00:35:02.483
Still, uh, prom sounds cool.

00:35:03.444 --> 00:35:05.441
Get to wear a tux and all.
(CHUCKLES)

00:35:06.435 --> 00:35:08.484
So what about you?
What are your plans after college?

00:35:08.495 --> 00:35:10.408
Pre-law.

00:35:10.415 --> 00:35:11.408
Okay.

00:35:11.415 --> 00:35:12.485
It's kind of a family tradition.

00:35:12.495 --> 00:35:15.495
I've been holding mock trials
with my mom since I was a kid.

00:35:16.402 --> 00:35:17.401
Really?

00:35:17.476 --> 00:35:20.469
Your Honor, the plaintiff petitions the
court for an increase in weekly allowance

00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:22.459
and suspended bedtime
during the summer months.

00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:23.499
And how'd that work out?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.459
-(CHUCKLES) You win some, you lose some.
-Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:28.459
No, but my mom's fair.

00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:30.410
She knows her stuff.

00:35:30.417 --> 00:35:32.460
Speaking of which, I should probably go.

00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:35.434
It's getting late,
and my mom tends to worry.

00:35:35.444 --> 00:35:36.443
Yeah.

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.471
Um, can I give you a ride?

00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:40.430
Sure.

the states and territories

DAVID: See how
they're linked with that rope?

00:35:54.453 --> 00:35:56.455
It symbolizes the country's unified effort.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.449
MARTIN: "The Freedom Wall
bears a field of 4,000 golden stars,

00:36:01.457 --> 00:36:05.483
each of which stands for
100 American military deaths in the war."

00:36:08.481 --> 00:36:11.407

to walk me to the door.

00:36:23.449 --> 00:36:24.448

-Such a gentleman.

Oh, my grandma. She's staying with us
while my parents are out of town.

00:36:35.494 --> 00:36:37.420

I'm so sorry. I really gotta go. I...

00:36:40.404 --> 00:36:42.437
I mean, you know,
she's not babysitting me or anything.

00:36:42.444 --> 00:36:44.403
I'm way old enough for that.

00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:46.405

but I feel confident.

these homeschool statistics.

00:37:04.403 --> 00:37:05.426
So much to learn.

The Washington Monument
is 55 feet at the base and 555 feet high.

00:37:12.414 --> 00:37:17.470
At the very top, there's an aluminum cap
where there's an inscription, "<i>Laus Deo."</i>

00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:23.465
Two words, seven letters, overlooking
the most powerful city in the world.

00:37:26.425 --> 00:37:28.415
It means, "Praise be to God."

Thank you, Jimmy.

00:38:20.447 --> 00:38:23.450
I just wanna make sure you understand
what you're fighting here.

00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:27.401
I was able to do some fact-finding
on St. Jude's co-op before I left home...

00:38:27.411 --> 00:38:28.410
Mm-hmm.

00:38:28.418 --> 00:38:30.412
...and I think the commission's
gonna be pleased

00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:32.462
on how well our students do
on standardized tests.

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:35.421
Mmm. Yeah, well, right now
there's an effort under way

00:38:35.432 --> 00:38:37.429
demanding universal
educational guidelines.

00:38:38.429 --> 00:38:39.428
Sounds reasonable.

00:38:39.436 --> 00:38:40.449
Oh, it's meant to.

00:38:41.423 --> 00:38:44.420
But make no mistake,
those guidelines are increasingly at odds

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.413
with the Christian worldview.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.406
There won't be any opt-out
for homeschoolers.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.486
Homeschooling
is like a weed to these folks,

00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:52.437
and they just wanna yank it out.

00:38:53.424 --> 00:38:54.430
But why?

00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:56.434
Why indeed?

00:38:57.438 --> 00:38:58.490
In the Common Core agenda--

00:38:59.401 --> 00:39:02.441
Excuse me, "curriculum" --
everything's relative.

00:39:02.451 --> 00:39:05.448
And I mean everything
from kindergarten on.

00:39:05.455 --> 00:39:08.454
<i>Even basic facts are seen as subjective.</i>

00:39:08.465 --> 00:39:11.482
Common Core deliberately
creates the illusion

00:39:11.489 --> 00:39:14.438
there's no such thing as truth.

00:39:14.449 --> 00:39:17.499
Because if truth doesn't exist,
then there's no moral absolutes.

00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:21.486
And by middle school,
there's a discernible political agenda

00:39:21.493 --> 00:39:24.423
<i>behind the classroom reading lessons.</i>

00:39:24.434 --> 00:39:27.420
Ask your average millennial
about our Founding Fathers

00:39:27.427 --> 00:39:28.487
and they'll tell you that they were

00:39:28.494 --> 00:39:31.467
all a bunch of old and rich
oppressive slave owners.

00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:34.421
That perspective came from somewhere.

00:39:34.428 --> 00:39:35.427
But weren't they?

00:39:36.445 --> 00:39:38.401
Most of them were just kids.

00:39:39.405 --> 00:39:43.418
Edward Rutledge and Thomas Lynch,
both were just 26 years old

00:39:43.426 --> 00:39:45.405
<i>when they signed
the Declaration of Independence.</i>

00:39:45.412 --> 00:39:50.409
And Thomas Jefferson was the ripe old age
of 33 when he helped write it.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.446
And as far as owning slaves,
absolutely, some did,

00:39:54.473 --> 00:39:56.440
but many did not.

00:39:56.447 --> 00:39:58.453
But they all get tarred
with the same brush.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.460
But why? To what end?

00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:05.458
If you discredit them,
then you discredit what they gave us.

00:40:06.498 --> 00:40:11.438
Instead of the people having
their natural rights derived from God,

00:40:11.445 --> 00:40:12.494
we can convince the students

00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:18.465
that we only have those rights
which the government allows us,

00:40:18.476 --> 00:40:22.406
replacing our liberties with control.

00:40:23.483 --> 00:40:26.442

isn't sitting well with me.

00:44:22.463 --> 00:44:24.436
on the practice generally known
as homeschooling?

00:44:24.447 --> 00:44:25.446
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:28.406
Our department considers homeschooling

00:44:28.417 --> 00:44:32.447
an unusual, unnecessary
and borderline antisocial practice.

00:44:33.408 --> 00:44:34.484
And your further recommendations are?

00:44:34.491 --> 00:44:37.485
It's in the state's opinion,
we should be following Europe's lead.

00:44:37.492 --> 00:44:41.441
A number of European countries
have already outlawed homeschooling.

00:44:41.452 --> 00:44:44.451
Germany, Spain, the Netherlands,
and that's just to name a few.

00:44:44.459 --> 00:44:48.408
And in places where it is allowed,
like Sweden,

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:50.453
it's tightly regulated
and closely monitored.

00:44:51.456 --> 00:44:53.459
Thank you for your expert testimony.

00:44:56.437 --> 00:44:59.403
-Did you get any sleep?
-None. You?

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.404
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Same.

00:45:02.424 --> 00:45:04.411
Good morning. Daryl Smith.

00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:06.454
Mrs. Hays.

00:45:07.411 --> 00:45:08.410
-Mrs. McKinnon.
-Hi.

00:45:08.421 --> 00:45:09.488
-Mike McKinnon.
-Yes, sir.

00:45:10.438 --> 00:45:13.451
Reverend, I trust that Jimmy's Pizza
didn't give you nightmares.

00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:15.478
That's not what kept me up
last night.

00:45:15.489 --> 00:45:17.445
I can't thank you all enough
for making the trip,

00:45:17.456 --> 00:45:20.486
especially since I know
how difficult things are for you at home.

00:45:20.493 --> 00:45:23.429
We felt that we didn't have much
of a choice really.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.469
That's just it. You did.

00:45:24.476 --> 00:45:28.479
As believers, we've abandoned
the mountain of politics for far too long.

00:45:29.453 --> 00:45:31.494
We've decided that it's just
too dangerous of an arena

00:45:32.404 --> 00:45:33.453
for Christians to be walking into.

00:45:33.461 --> 00:45:35.410
So we just left it to anyone

00:45:35.421 --> 00:45:38.437
who wanted to go there
for their own selfish and worldly reasons,

00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:40.444
and hope that everything
will work out fine.

00:45:41.448 --> 00:45:44.445
Only it didn't,
and now we're in a mess.

00:45:44.455 --> 00:45:45.478
What's happening in there?

00:45:45.488 --> 00:45:48.412
They're still running testimony
for the other side.

00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:50.421
They should be finished
in about a half hour,

00:45:51.406 --> 00:45:52.422
and then it's your turn.

00:45:53.406 --> 00:45:55.472
If God is for us,
who can be against us?

00:45:55.479 --> 00:45:58.473
Well, around here,
just about everyone else.

00:46:00.433 --> 00:46:01.493
Maybe I've been in
Washington, DC too long.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.406
You guys relax.
Come and get you later, okay?

00:46:04.414 --> 00:46:05.413
Thank you.

00:46:10.484 --> 00:46:12.483
What color corsage do I get?

00:46:12.494 --> 00:46:15.411
Depends on what color dress
she's wearing.

00:46:15.418 --> 00:46:16.494
Well, how am I supposed to know that?

00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:21.462
It's kind of like a coral.

00:46:22.452 --> 00:46:24.411
-Coral?
-I got you.

00:46:25.462 --> 00:46:27.409
Everything okay with your grandmother?

00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:28.425
<i>Huh? Oh, yeah.</i>

00:46:28.433 --> 00:46:30.416
(CHUCKLES)
Um, I'm so sorry about that.

00:46:30.426 --> 00:46:32.475
My parents are in Washington.

00:46:32.483 --> 00:46:33.499
As in DC?

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.483
Yeah, they're actually testifying

00:46:35.493 --> 00:46:38.413
at a congressional subcommittee
on homeschooling.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.419
<i>Wow.</i>

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.497
I bet they must be pumped.

00:46:41.404 --> 00:46:42.447
No, no, no, not really.

00:46:42.454 --> 00:46:44.467
They actually had to go
because a judge here in town

00:46:44.478 --> 00:46:47.468
<i>threatened to fine them
if they didn't send us to public school.</i>

00:46:47.478 --> 00:46:49.411
-Does that look good with coral?
-Yes.

00:46:49.418 --> 00:46:51.462
A judge in Hope Springs?
Which one?

00:46:51.468 --> 00:46:55.428
I don't know, some, uh--
some family judge.

00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:56.495
Hey, I gotta run.
(CHUCKLES)

00:46:57.402 --> 00:46:59.499
<i>-Okay. I'll call you later.</i>

(MUTTERING)

00:47:11.467 --> 00:47:13.466
Strange place to cram for a test,
Reverend.

00:47:14.437 --> 00:47:16.440
Yeah, this is not really my thing.

00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:19.441
I'm afraid I'm gonna make things worse
for everyone out there.

00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:24.434
Matthew 10:19,
Do not worry about what you will say.

00:47:26.402 --> 00:47:28.438
At that time,
you will be given what to say."

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:30.432
For it will not be you speaking,

00:47:30.439 --> 00:47:34.469
but the Spirit of your Father
speaking through you."

00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:36.466
There's been a development.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:41.416
We have a new chairman, a Robert Benson.

00:47:41.423 --> 00:47:43.443
I'm guessing he's not as friendly
as Abercrombie.

00:47:43.454 --> 00:47:44.453
Hardly.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.454
The direction out there, the narrative,
is going to change considerably.

00:47:49.444 --> 00:47:51.460
They are going to insist
that religious beliefs

00:47:51.471 --> 00:47:56.424
are anti-rational,
anti-science and antisocial.

00:47:57.435 --> 00:48:01.479
Show them that religious beliefs
are supported through rational thought,

00:48:01.489 --> 00:48:05.409
with a basis on the US law and tradition.

00:48:06.419 --> 00:48:07.472
I think I have a card for that.

00:48:08.453 --> 00:48:12.462
And also, I need you
to make them understand

00:48:12.473 --> 00:48:16.403
that if they insist
on trampling believers' rights,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:19.409
well, sir, they are in for a fight.

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:21.460
You got this.

00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:28.461
SMITH:<i> Mr. Willoughby,</i>

00:48:28.471 --> 00:48:33.448
you have a strong attachment to the idea
of developing a nationalized curriculum,

00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:34.464
do you not?

00:48:34.475 --> 00:48:37.481
Yes, because it's in the best interest
of our children.

00:48:37.492 --> 00:48:39.472
I'm just concerned
that we're working awfully hard here

00:48:39.479 --> 00:48:42.442
to violate one of our own existing laws,

00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:45.490
the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965,

00:48:45.496 --> 00:48:49.492
which prevents us
from nationalizing any school curriculum.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.463
I mean, we passed a law
that said we wouldn't do that.

00:48:53.474 --> 00:48:57.497
We've achieved a way
to avoid violating the spirit of that law

00:48:58.408 --> 00:48:59.491
with Common Core.

00:48:59.498 --> 00:49:02.424
We merely propose the guidelines.

00:49:02.498 --> 00:49:04.451
The states adopt the measures
on their own.

00:49:04.462 --> 00:49:07.448
On their own, without any pressure
from the government?

00:49:07.459 --> 00:49:09.428
None whatsoever.

00:49:10.429 --> 00:49:13.482
SMITH: Mr. Willoughby, if you succeed
in gaining approval for your curriculum,

00:49:13.493 --> 00:49:18.402
would parents be able to opt out
or be allowed to opt out of their program?

00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:23.400
I'd encourage the states to require
full participation without exception.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:24.493
What gives them the right to do that?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.480
Well, once we determine
what every child needs to know,

00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:32.467
it becomes imperative
that every child know it.

00:49:32.478 --> 00:49:37.415
After all,
the children belong to all of us.

00:49:37.422 --> 00:49:38.481
SMITH: Interesting perspective.

00:49:38.488 --> 00:49:41.479
There are parents waiting in the wings,

00:49:41.485 --> 00:49:47.482
waiting to testify that their children,
in fact, belong to them...

00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:50.479
and not to all of us.

00:49:52.496 --> 00:49:54.463
But thank you for your candor.

00:49:59.407 --> 00:50:00.440
They're ready for you.

00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:03.421
Okay, come on.

00:50:14.405 --> 00:50:16.454
BENSON: Would the witnesses state
their names for the record?

00:50:16.466 --> 00:50:18.482
MIKE: Yes, sir.

Taylor Hays, Your Honor.

00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:25.439
This is not a courtroom, Ms. Hays,
and I most certainly am not a judge.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.469
Please refer to me as Mr. Chairman.

00:50:27.477 --> 00:50:28.476
And I'm David Hill.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.434
Reverend David Hill.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.424
Yes, sir. The preacher.

00:50:34.427 --> 00:50:36.426
We'd like to thank the subcommittee
for having us.

00:50:36.437 --> 00:50:40.437
Um, well, now that who we all are
has been established.

00:50:41.428 --> 00:50:43.475
Mr. Chairman, my husband
and I have our two children

00:50:43.485 --> 00:50:45.478
in the St. Jude homeschooling co-op,

00:50:45.488 --> 00:50:48.491
and they continue to perform better
on standardized testing

00:50:49.402 --> 00:50:51.411
than their public
and private school peers.

00:50:51.422 --> 00:50:54.428
Giving us a good reason to believe
that we're doing something right.

00:50:54.439 --> 00:50:56.419
Well, I should begin by letting you know

00:50:56.426 --> 00:50:59.406
that we've had a series of experts
pass through here,

00:50:59.413 --> 00:51:01.440
all of them assuring us
that we have nothing to fear

00:51:01.447 --> 00:51:03.426
from a standardized education.

00:51:03.437 --> 00:51:06.470
With all due respect,
in this particular case,

00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:10.423
we believe that the experts are wrong.
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:11.490
Let me give you an example.

00:51:11.498 --> 00:51:14.497
So in our district, they teach
a revisionist version of history,

00:51:15.408 --> 00:51:18.478
which is both progressive
and anti-faith in equal measure.

00:51:18.488 --> 00:51:21.458
And so if our children are forced
onto its Common Core track,

00:51:21.465 --> 00:51:24.425
they will never learn
about the faith-based underpinnings

00:51:24.432 --> 00:51:26.481
of the US Constitution
or its Bill of Rights.

00:51:26.493 --> 00:51:28.479
They'll never hear
about George Washington's plea

00:51:28.489 --> 00:51:31.483
for the blessing of almighty God
at his inauguration.

00:51:31.493 --> 00:51:34.423
MIKE: They're not taught anything
that reflects positively

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.413
on America's Christian heritage,

00:51:36.423 --> 00:51:40.400
despite the fact that America's history
and its faith traditions

00:51:40.411 --> 00:51:41.440
are so deeply intertwined.

00:51:41.447 --> 00:51:45.443
Well, that is not what our experts
have testified to here today.

00:51:45.451 --> 00:51:46.460
What about Thanksgiving?

00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:48.484
-Excuse me?
-DAVID: Thanksgiving.

00:51:48.495 --> 00:51:51.464
You know, pilgrims, turkeys,
Native Americans.

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:54.412
-I'm familiar with the holiday.
-DAVID: Well, sure you are.

00:51:54.419 --> 00:51:56.478
From kindergarten onward,
every child learns about it.

00:51:56.486 --> 00:51:58.479
But what do they learn?

00:51:58.486 --> 00:52:02.466
This is the NEA's own statement
regarding Thanksgiving.

00:52:03.466 --> 00:52:07.410
The National Education Association
believes that Thanksgiving

00:52:07.417 --> 00:52:10.460
is the recognition of unity
and the rich American diversity

00:52:10.467 --> 00:52:12.493
that was embodied
in the settlement of America."

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.484
Well, that sounds completely reasonable.

00:52:14.494 --> 00:52:18.450
Well, that would've come as a big surprise
to the pilgrims that were actually there.

00:52:19.428 --> 00:52:21.480
They came together
to thank God for the bountiful harvest.

00:52:22.448 --> 00:52:26.471
Now, the Native Americans
were fellow guests. Yes, absolutely.

00:52:26.482 --> 00:52:29.405
But God was the reason for the feast.

00:52:29.415 --> 00:52:31.482
And to indicate that the purpose
of the first Thanksgiving

00:52:31.489 --> 00:52:35.469
was primarily a multicultural event
is a fabrication.

00:52:35.479 --> 00:52:38.416
And if we don't teach
the Common Core myth,

00:52:38.423 --> 00:52:40.466

going to jail for contempt.

What is your point, Ms. Hays?

00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:17.431
There's a common misconception
of homeschool parents,

00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:20.481
particularly those of faith,
that we're some kind of flat-earthers.

00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:25.431
My seven-year-old
knows that the Earth is round

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:29.408
and that the sunrise is an illusion
caused by the Earth's rotation.

00:57:29.415 --> 00:57:31.465
And when tested in physics or chemistry

00:57:31.476 --> 00:57:34.419
about the rate of acceleration
of a falling object

00:57:34.429 --> 00:57:38.475
or the atomic mass of cesium,
acceptable answers do not include, "Jesus"

00:57:38.483 --> 00:57:40.466
or, "Whatever God wants it to be."

00:57:41.671 --> 00:57:42.732
And lastly,

my husband was a United States

and died in service to this country.

The phrases

01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:22.427
will stand for nothing except hypocrisy,

sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia
or any form of intolerance"?

01:02:30.482 --> 01:02:34.445
I think it says more about the bias
of the former civil rights chairman

01:02:34.456 --> 01:02:37.412
than it does about
the supposed biases of believers.

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:53.417
Considering the time when it was written,

01:02:53.428 --> 01:02:56.468
the Bible is one of the most
pro-feminist documents in history.

01:02:56.478 --> 01:02:59.484
In an era where women were treated
as property to be bought and sold...

01:02:59.495 --> 01:03:03.401
Paul ordered women to cover up their hair,

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:04.465
to wear a veil in the assembly.

01:03:05.419 --> 01:03:07.425
Do you think I need
to wear a veil for you?

Single women in the Roman Empire

01:03:09.479 --> 01:03:14.499
were required by law to unveil their hair
for the visual pleasure of men.

01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:19.420
It would be like today if we forced
a young woman to dress immodestly

To get around that,
you either had to be married or widowed.

So when Paul told women
to wear a veil in the assembly,

01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:31.427
he was adding to the dignity of women,

as good as a married woman or a widow

on display, at least not in here."

01:04:50.413 --> 01:04:53.453
instead of lumping everyone together
in a single one-size-fits-all model?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.412
How is that diversity?

01:04:55.423 --> 01:04:59.436
The public school system
is there for us as a society.

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:01.420
The people are not there for it.

01:05:01.427 --> 01:05:05.447
As soon as it stops working for the kids,
parents are obligated to leave.

01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:12.475
MIKE:<i> The parents
of the homeschooling co-op</i>

01:05:12.482 --> 01:05:14.495
take seriously
our duty to instruct our children,

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:18.488
to teach them, to educate them,
to decide what is best for them.

01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:21.465
It's a natural extension of our beliefs.

01:05:21.476 --> 01:05:24.466
Beliefs that I consider
to be divisive and intolerant.

01:05:24.476 --> 01:05:28.449
Only because you label intolerant
anyone who you don't agree with,

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.443
and you label divisive
as anyone who doesn't agree with you.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.413
The gospels describe Jesus
as teaching his followers

01:05:35.424 --> 01:05:39.427
to forgive each other,
to love their enemies,

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:41.414
show generosity to those in need

01:05:41.425 --> 01:05:43.494
and embrace those
outside their ethnic circles.

01:05:44.401 --> 01:05:45.464
Would you call that divisive?

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:48.431
Christ commanded his followers
to advance his message

01:05:48.442 --> 01:05:52.429
with the irresistible force of love
and the power of truth.

01:05:52.499 --> 01:05:54.458
Would you call that intolerant?

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:57.446
No one has a monopoly on the truth,
Mr. Hill. Not even you.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:06:01.459
No. But if God exists,
then he has the monopoly on it

01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:04.483
and we hold that he does exist
and has spoken.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.430
Your truth, sir, not mine.

01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:08.443
DAVID: Except that's not the way
that truth works.

01:06:08.451 --> 01:06:11.427
Truth is truth
for everyone and everywhere.

01:06:11.481 --> 01:06:16.494
Even if over time, it loses its popularity
or becomes politically incorrect.

01:06:17.462 --> 01:06:20.438
That's what the parents
of these children understand.

01:06:20.448 --> 01:06:24.448
That in a society where
suddenly everything is relative,

01:06:24.456 --> 01:06:29.446
truth is absolute,
a transcendent thing not of this world.

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.436
Something that they have
no power to change.

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:36.446
America was founded on these principles,
and if we just throw them away--

01:06:36.453 --> 01:06:37.466
I think we're done here.

01:06:37.474 --> 01:06:40.403
I would like to thank the witnesses
for their input.

01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:41.423
They're free to go.

01:06:41.434 --> 01:06:43.471
This hearing is now adjourned
for one hour.

01:06:43.481 --> 01:06:46.414
After which,
we will vote on this issue.

01:06:49.418 --> 01:06:50.417
DAVID: Mr. Chairman.

01:06:50.485 --> 01:06:53.468
Mr. Chairman, you haven't ruled
on our situation.

01:06:53.475 --> 01:06:57.442
I'm sorry, sir, that you have
misunderstood the purpose of this hearing.

01:06:57.452 --> 01:06:58.451
Thank you.

01:07:00.402 --> 01:07:02.443
Wait, what does he mean
"The purpose of this hearing"?

01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:05.416
I'm not sure.
I mean, is any of this going to matter?

01:07:05.423 --> 01:07:06.442
It has to.

01:07:06.453 --> 01:07:08.493
I mean, even when it turns out
we're still under a court order

01:07:09.403 --> 01:07:11.453
and facing all kinds of fines
when we get home?

01:07:18.424 --> 01:07:19.454
Are you sure?

01:07:20.488 --> 01:07:21.487
Yeah.

01:07:23.401 --> 01:07:24.400
I see.

01:07:26.435 --> 01:07:27.434
Okay.

You really should have had yourself

is gonna have any effect on what we do?

01:08:08.479 --> 01:08:12.496
You see, we do these things
because we're supposed to,

01:08:13.406 --> 01:08:14.483
because supposedly somebody's watching.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.409
But other than a few C-SPAN junkies,
is anybody really paying attention?

Look, I understand your position.

01:08:32.462 --> 01:08:36.414
You feel that you're making
a last-ditch stand for your faith,

01:08:36.425 --> 01:08:39.431
and you've chosen this
as a hill that you're willing to die on.

01:08:39.442 --> 01:08:42.466
Our whole faith started because one man
chose a hill he was willing to die on.

01:08:42.476 --> 01:08:47.470
Yes, but that was a long time ago
and now nobody really cares.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.450
Let's face it, your God, your book,
they're in the way.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.466
They're in the way of moral relativism.

01:08:54.461 --> 01:08:57.410
They're in the way
of calling good evil and evil good.

01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.480
What did you plan to accomplish here today?

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:05.411
To defend the rights of parents
to educate their children as they see fit.

01:09:05.418 --> 01:09:06.465
And to make Congress promise

01:09:06.472 --> 01:09:08.495
that they will never threaten
those rights again.

01:09:09.402 --> 01:09:10.495
-Yes.
-Sir, that is not gonna happen.

01:09:11.462 --> 01:09:13.461
In a few minutes,
we're gonna go back in there,

01:09:13.469 --> 01:09:15.418
we're gonna take a quick straw vote,

01:09:15.429 --> 01:09:18.463
which is gonna find in favor
of the experts' recommendations.

Experts.

01:09:20.413 --> 01:09:22.457
And then we're gonna push this through
just like we planned.

-Just like that?
-Just like that.

01:09:29.464 --> 01:09:33.417
I'd be careful about going to war
against God's church.

01:09:33.424 --> 01:09:36.448
Scripture promises the gates of hell
will not prevail against it.

01:09:36.455 --> 01:09:38.468
This is not hell, Mr. Hill.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:39.474
This is Washington.

01:09:39.485 --> 01:09:41.405
Close enough.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.448
For 2,000 years,
men have tried to get rid of Christianity.

I really thought the Lord
would intervene on our behalf.

Before you say anything else,
I wanna show you all something.

01:10:19.472 --> 01:10:20.485

01:10:40.461 --> 01:10:42.431
I didn't hear you.

01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:48.471
They say you're a man.
Then come down and face me like one.

You're more than a man, no?

Then tell me, Son of God,
why did you take Ayisha from me?

She's my daughter.

Are you punishing her?

Did she displease you?

Or are you punishing me?

01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:45.456

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.427
She's a replica.

01:12:48.437 --> 01:12:49.460
Do you know her story?

01:12:52.428 --> 01:12:55.427
The bronze was cast in 1861
outside of Washington.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.428
Her name is Freedom.

01:12:58.478 --> 01:13:01.412
And in one of those ironies
that God seems to delight in,

01:13:01.422 --> 01:13:05.459
Philip Reid, the foundry foreman
in charge of casting her, was a slave.

01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:08.435
A gifted artisan,
but a slave nonetheless.

01:13:09.406 --> 01:13:12.479
But by the time the Capitol dome
was ready to receive her in 1863,

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:15.453
the Emancipation Proclamation
was in full effect.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.457
Meaning that Philip Reid
most likely stood outside of this building

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:24.437
and watched her go aloft as a free man.

01:13:26.414 --> 01:13:29.424
And all the hands
that strained at the hoisting ropes

01:13:29.431 --> 01:13:31.431
all belonged to former slaves.

01:13:34.412 --> 01:13:35.445
In my mind,

01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:40.475
any country that can do that
is worth fighting for.

01:13:41.473 --> 01:13:45.425
So that is exactly what we need to do...
keep fighting.

for the likes of Chairman Benson.

will be more familiar to you...

in order to form a more perfect union--"

"Establish justice."

01:16:27.466 --> 01:16:28.482
We can't stop.

01:16:28.493 --> 01:16:30.459
We're stronger together.

01:16:30.466 --> 01:16:32.463
I am "We the people."

01:16:32.473 --> 01:16:33.499
We all are.

01:16:36.413 --> 01:16:37.423
We all are.

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:50.440
I can't believe how I missed this.

01:16:54.468 --> 01:16:57.424
Wait, where you going?
We got a plane to catch.

01:16:57.492 --> 01:16:59.432
I'll be back in five minutes.

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:08.452
JACKSON: My daddy used to fly airplanes.

01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:10.443
He wore the same as you.

01:17:11.447 --> 01:17:13.403
He's in heaven now.

01:17:16.444 --> 01:17:17.443
I see.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.487
You must miss him terribly.

01:17:25.422 --> 01:17:27.481
If he could be with you, he would.

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:29.482
This I know.

01:17:29.489 --> 01:17:31.432
How do you know?

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:35.448
Because everyfather
will always choose his child over...

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:43.486
I would go to heaven
so Daddy could come back for Mommy.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:44.496
No, child.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.497
You mustn't say such a thing.

01:17:49.407 --> 01:17:51.406
That is an evil and pointless wish.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.414
But Mommy's always so sad.

01:17:53.421 --> 01:17:55.441
That's because she's forgotten
that our lives...

01:17:58.408 --> 01:17:59.434
belong to God.

01:18:00.492 --> 01:18:04.472
We must trust that God knows best.

01:18:06.442 --> 01:18:10.488
Do you really think
your mom would be less sad without you?

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.433
She loves you.

01:18:19.434 --> 01:18:20.450
She needs you.

01:18:29.428 --> 01:18:31.484

01:20:14.432 --> 01:20:17.405
Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield
my time to the witness...

01:20:19.406 --> 01:20:20.422
Reverend David Hill.

01:20:21.446 --> 01:20:22.445
That's fine,

01:20:22.453 --> 01:20:25.479
but I remind the witness
he's limited to five minutes.

DAVID:<i> Thank you, Congressman Smith,</i>
<i>Mr. Chairman,</i>

01:20:46.402 --> 01:20:47.488
<i>for allowing me these last five minutes.</i>

01:20:52.492 --> 01:20:54.482
You ever been on one
of those sightseeing tours

01:20:54.489 --> 01:20:56.448
they have here in Washington?

01:20:57.493 --> 01:21:01.442
You know the kind where they take you
to see all the monuments?

01:21:01.453 --> 01:21:05.406
Yes, I believe most of us have visited
the city's major attractions.

01:21:06.477 --> 01:21:07.483
Baba.

01:21:11.407 --> 01:21:13.457
DAVID:<i> Maybe you ought to think
about going again,</i>

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:16.444
cause those... how did you put that?

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:21.495
Um, attractions are here for a reason,

01:21:23.429 --> 01:21:24.478
and I almost missed it.

01:21:26.402 --> 01:21:28.405
<i>I don't know how, because
you can't throw a rock in this city</i>

01:21:28.412 --> 01:21:30.425
<i>without hitting a statue
or a monument of some kind.</i>

01:21:30.436 --> 01:21:34.453
I mean, every street,
every building in this city,

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:36.403
all the marble and the granite,

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:39.490
the brick and the stone,
they're trying to tell us something.

01:21:40.494 --> 01:21:44.443
They're saying, "Don't forget about us.

01:21:46.431 --> 01:21:49.407
"Don't forget about
the battles that we fought

01:21:49.415 --> 01:21:51.471
"and the price that we paid for freedom.

01:21:52.462 --> 01:21:54.488
"Don't let our sacrifice be in vain."

01:21:57.422 --> 01:21:59.462
You wanna hear something interesting,
Mr. Chairman?

01:22:00.466 --> 01:22:03.413
I have three friends
that have a pretty good understanding

01:22:03.423 --> 01:22:05.406
of what's at stake here today,

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.406
and the funny thing is,
is they're not even from America.

01:22:11.447 --> 01:22:18.414
They're from faraway places
like China, Iran, Africa.

01:22:22.408 --> 01:22:23.427
But they get it.

01:22:25.401 --> 01:22:26.485
They know what's at stake here.

01:22:27.495 --> 01:22:32.451
And maybe in order to understand how
precious and fragile freedom really is,

01:22:32.462 --> 01:22:33.492
maybe...

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:37.479
maybe you have to lose it.

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:41.429
But you already know that.

01:22:41.436 --> 01:22:45.470
I mean all of this,
it's just a distraction.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.420
And I made it easy for you, didn't I?

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.403
I bet your face just lit up

01:22:50.414 --> 01:22:53.411
when you realized that there was a pastor
on the witness list.

01:22:53.418 --> 01:22:55.481
You knew that if you challenged scriptures,

01:22:55.488 --> 01:22:57.468
I would rise to defend them.

01:22:57.478 --> 01:22:59.487
It's kind of in my job description.

01:22:59.498 --> 01:23:01.445
You figured you'd run out the clock

01:23:01.452 --> 01:23:05.468
while we debated how women
wore their hair 2,000 years ago,

01:23:05.479 --> 01:23:08.419
all in hopes that no one would realize

01:23:08.429 --> 01:23:10.402
that it's really their freedoms
that are on the line.

01:23:10.413 --> 01:23:11.472
Not at all, sir.

01:23:11.483 --> 01:23:13.463
The issue here today is homeschooling.

01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:15.422
I wish it was, Mr. Chairman.

01:23:15.473 --> 01:23:16.486
I truly do.

01:23:16.497 --> 01:23:18.420
No, today...

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.464
Today was about turning
neighbor against neighbor.

01:23:22.434 --> 01:23:24.431
That's part of your plan, isn't it?

01:23:24.437 --> 01:23:26.440
Keep us all divided.

01:23:26.451 --> 01:23:28.491
So bit by bit, we don't realize

01:23:29.401 --> 01:23:31.464
you're chipping away
at our freedoms and liberties.

01:23:31.471 --> 01:23:34.491
You got us all talking about how Noah
got all the animals on the ark.

01:23:35.402 --> 01:23:37.415
Meanwhile, you're crafting legislation

01:23:37.422 --> 01:23:40.425
that will allow the government
to barge into our homes.

01:23:41.436 --> 01:23:43.433
Because it's all about power for you.

01:23:43.439 --> 01:23:45.466
And the only way that
you can get more power

01:23:45.473 --> 01:23:47.482
is by taking it from someone else.

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:50.437
And that would be all well and good
if it wasn't for that pesky thing

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:52.473
called the Constitution that keeps
getting in your way.

01:23:52.484 --> 01:23:53.486
Now you hold on a second.

01:23:53.494 --> 01:23:55.457
No, I'm done talking to you!

01:23:55.467 --> 01:23:58.407
I'm talking to the people who elected you.

01:23:58.417 --> 01:24:02.477
Because as inconvenient as it is, sir,
this is where your power comes from!

01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:04.474
-Order!
-You see those statues

01:24:04.485 --> 01:24:06.425
and those monuments out there?

01:24:06.435 --> 01:24:09.484
They say, "You work for us!"

01:24:10.455 --> 01:24:12.445
You are out of order, Mr. Hill.

01:24:12.456 --> 01:24:16.489
A government of the people,
by the people, for the people.

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:23.410
Order! You are out of order, Mr. Hill.

01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:26.437
Order!

01:24:26.444 --> 01:24:27.443
Bailiff.

01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:32.454
So stay out of our homes and churches,

01:24:32.461 --> 01:24:35.424
and, yes, stay out
of our children's education.

01:24:35.478 --> 01:24:38.415
Because what you call teaching,
Mr. Chairman,

01:24:38.465 --> 01:24:40.448
is really social engineering.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.438
You are out of order, Mr. Hill!

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:43.461
History is being rewritten.

01:24:43.472 --> 01:24:47.499
Biology is redefined
and right and wrong are erased.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:51.425
Our children don't belong to the government

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:53.432
and neither does our country.

01:24:53.443 --> 01:24:57.489
America belongs to its citizens,
to each and all.

01:24:57.497 --> 01:25:01.463
From the farmers in Texas to
the window cleaners in New York,

01:25:01.474 --> 01:25:05.400
to the cabinet makers in Maine
and the teachers in Oklahoma,

01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:08.424
to every man, woman and child,

01:25:08.431 --> 01:25:09.494
it belongs to the people!

01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:15.452
We the people.
