00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.735
<i>Sometimes all it
takes is a spark.</i>

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.536
<i>Something very small.</i>

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.173
<i>But the spark becomes a flame.</i>

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.218
<i>And if that flame spreads,</i>

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.310
<i>the power can be so overwhelming</i>

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.082
<i>it transforms
everything around it.</i>

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.134
<i>We begin with breaking news from</i>

00:00:58.158 --> 00:00:59.802
<i>- Hope Springs, Arkansas...
- People are up</i>

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.738
<i>in arms, speaking out
against what they believe...</i>

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.806
<i>only religious leader
who refused to abide...</i>

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.822
<i>David Hill, you're under arrest.</i>

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.431
<i>Contempt of court.</i>

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.245
<i>You failed to produce your
sermons upon court order.</i>

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.794
<i>Please put your hands
behind your back.</i>

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.573
<i>Who feel the state is
overstepping its bounds.</i>

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.403
<i>A subpoena of
sermons is needless</i>

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.291
<i>- and unprecedented.
- This is a witch hunt</i>

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.408
<i>to silence religion...</i>

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.423
<i>We're seeing more</i>

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.429
<i>and more protests
around the city</i>

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.123
since local pastor, David Hill,

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.859
was arrested for
contempt of court.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.863
Hill refused to abide
by a controversial

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.866
<i>government mandate
to turn over transcripts</i>

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.504
<i>of his sermons
to city officials.</i>

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.576
<i>And right now a
contentious and heated</i>

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.576
<i>free-speech debate is
threatening to boil over</i>

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:54.444
<i>while the pastor sits in
jail waiting for a ruling.</i>

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.853
Let's go.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.135
Appreciate it.

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.176
- Hey.
- Jude.

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.478
You want to get some waffles?

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.417
Of course I want
to get some waffles.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.717
Free Reverend Dave!
Free Reverend Dave!

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.155
Free Reverend Dave!

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.636
<i>Reverend, what
do you have to say</i>

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.151
<i>about being released today?</i>

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.287
I am grateful to the
court that they recognize

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.263
that this mandate
was unconstitutional.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.391
I think this is more of
a human rights issue.

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:48.901
It's about our
right to seek truth

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.171
and to share that
truth with others.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.582
<i>But considering your church</i>

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.165
<i>is associated with
a public university,</i>

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.573
how do you define
"truth" exactly?

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.476
Truth is a person.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.775
The person of Jesus Christ.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.407
It's the one truth

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.349
- above all others.
- What do you have to say

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.478
to the people here
who are calling...

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.887
<i>Jesus Christ is the
one truth? Really?</i>

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.635
This guy just can't
help himself, can he?

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.424
This guy is a pastor who
was jailed for his beliefs.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.192
<i>What if it was a Jewish rabbi
that said there was one truth?</i>

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.267
<i>- Or a Muslim imam?
- They have that right.</i>

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.359
<i>- Freedom of worship.
- In places of worship.</i>

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.404
But Hadleigh is
a state university.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.915
<i>See, and that's
the question, y'all.</i>

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.567
What's a church doing
on a state campus

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.700
- in the first place?
- We're seeing more and more

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.854
<i>- protests around the city.
- Students are actually calling</i>

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.312
for the removal of Saint James

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.693
<i>from Hadleigh campus altogether.</i>

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.444
As the battle rages
on in Hope Springs...

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.894
<i>A historic landmark that has</i>

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.784
<i>served this community
for over a century.</i>

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.821
<i>And now they want
the church gone.</i>

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:44.619
<i>This is what our
country has come to.</i>

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:04.004
You gonna ask her out or what?

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.574
Excuse me?

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.615
We drive all the way
out here every week,

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.013
drop off all this food.

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.252
Why don't you
finally ask the girl out?

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.820
She feeds homeless people, Jude.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.445
That's why we donate the food.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.285
Yes, but she
obviously likes you.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.586
No way.

00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:22.356
What's a six-letter
word for "clueless"?

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.896
Fine.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.023
You're still working
on that thing?

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.529
I'm much faster
when it's in Swahili.

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:31.298
Fair enough.

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:34.283
<i>This tab's already been paid.</i>

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:36.367
You guys enjoy.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.745
- Hey, convict.
- Hey.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.838
<i>Just can't stay out of the news</i>

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.678
these days, can you?

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:46.549
Yeah, I've never had so
many people care what I think.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.884
Well, I'm on your
side. You know that.

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:50.514
Busy today, huh?

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.819
Busy's good.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.325
The more people
we feed, the better.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.554
Hey, thank your
congregation for all this.

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:56.994
Couldn't do it without y'all.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.062
- I'll see you next Saturday.
- Hold up.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.601
From last night.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.731
Pork chops turned out great.

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.469
Thanks.

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:23.885
Told you.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.856
Who asked you?

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:45.641
<i>Wonder what my
father would think.</i>

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.738
When he was a pastor,
he'd leave these doors open

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.841
day and night... didn't matter.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.614
Now we hire armed
security guards

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.450
to protect us from
the same people

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.023
we're supposed
to be ministering to.

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:59.820
It's just fear, David,
and it can be overcome.

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.554
You know this.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:03.027
Do you ever complain?

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.597
You know where I come from.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.667
I've seen my share of struggles.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.736
But one thing has never changed.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.738
God is good all the time.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.900
All the time, God is good.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.641
<i>I appreciate you all</i>

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.977
<i>braving the angry mobs
and picketers again.</i>

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.812
But even with all the noise

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.443
going on out there, I
just want to assure you

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.990
that Saint James has been
around for over 150 years,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.753
and despite what those
picket signs say out there,

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:35.556
- we're not going anywhere.
- Amen.

00:06:35.662 --> 00:06:38.689
Now, looking forward, I
have some very good news.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.165
Jude, you want to come up?

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:49.465
I couldn't be happier to share
that our very own Jude Mbaye

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.135
has accepted a
permanent position

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.744
with us here at Saint
James as my co-pastor.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.817
Amen. Welcome, brother.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.647
Thank you.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.552
You know, I realized
tonight that, uh,

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:04.522
it's been a long
time since I've felt

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.525
like I had a real
brother in my life.

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.996
David, are you
sharing your feelings?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.032
Okay, let's not make
a big deal out of it.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:16.126
I'm just saying that
I'm grateful for you.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.462
I'm excited.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.834
I feel the same.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.704
Now can we get some waffles?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.145
- What was that?
- I don't know.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.818
- Hey! Hey! Get back here!
- David!

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.650
David, no!

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:47.625
You call the police.

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:50.169
- I'll shut off the alarm.
- Yeah.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.231
<i>Yeah, this is, uh,
Reverend David Hill.</i>

00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.942
I'm a... I'm a pastor
at Saint James.

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.123
<i>Well, no, it's not an emergency.</i>

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.750
It's just a, uh... it
was a broken window

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.987
<i>to the basement.</i>

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:40.545
Jude?

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.187
Jude?

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.827
Jude?

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:57.168
Jude?

00:08:58.238 --> 00:08:59.238
Oh, no.

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:00.865
David...

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:02.670
You're gonna be okay.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:05.109
All right? Stay with me.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.736
Okay.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.949
Come on, pal.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.266
Jude, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.936
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.973
Stay with me.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.878
Please, God, help me.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.297
David...

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.973
Don't talk, brother. Don't talk.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.373
Just stay with me.

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:12.145
Help is coming.

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:14.111
Hold on, Jude. It's okay.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.348
What?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.200
What are you saying?

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.749
What does that mean?

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:28.124
Jude?

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:30.322
Jude.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.121
Jude.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.100
Please, God, no.

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.396
Jude. Help!

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:38.995
Stay with me, brother.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.973
Jude...

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.273
No.

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:32.221
<i>I'm so tired of all the noise.</i>

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:36.260
<i>Everyone yelling.</i>

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.853
<i>On the news.</i>

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:39.296
<i>In the classroom.</i>

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:42.429
<i>Even in church.</i>

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.730
<i>I can barely hear You anymore.</i>

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:55.442
<i>Are You even there?</i>

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.880
<i>I hope You are.</i>

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.359
<i>'Cause I feel so lost, God.</i>

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.351
I'm starting to feel pretty dumb

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:12.261
talking to myself when
You don't talk back, so...

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.862
Wherever You are...

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:20.031
I'm still here.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.276
Hey.

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:25.038
Hi.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:27.443
I stopped at Stella's,
got you the good stuff.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.225
- You're my hero. Thank you.
- I know.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.376
You're welcome.

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.748
- How's your day?
- Good.

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:36.983
Wow, this looks, uh, fun.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.257
You can get it if you want.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.794
It's Sunday.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:44.896
Oh, that's right.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.900
You're... "in church."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.229
Don't be a jerk.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.495
Why don't you just tell 'em?

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.293
Adam, my parents
would be devastated

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:53.305
if they found out I
was even questioning.

00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:54.999
Okay, you have no idea.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.337
Yeah, I do.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.877
I did my time as
a kid, remember?

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.174
I just got out
sooner than you did.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.182
Okay, can we
not talk about this?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.480
Sure.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.183
I get it.

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.350
What you're going through.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.486
I really do.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.327
Okay, go to your study group.

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:21.799
I have work to do.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.268
- Are you kicking me out?
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.032
Fine.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.903
- See you later.
- Okay. Bye.

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:29.498
Thanks for the snack.

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.287
<i>Okay, wait, wait.</i>

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.110
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.252
<i>So, you're saying</i>

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.592
that because the Kit Kat
logo doesn't have a hyphen,

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:52.923
it proves there are
multiple realities?

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:54.392
Okay, look, you're
oversimplifying,

00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.245
- but yes, exactly.
- How am I oversimplifying?

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:57.413
That's exactly what you said.

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:58.847
Yeah, but it's not
just Kit Kat, though.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:13:59.871
It's a lot of things.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:00.983
- Like what?
- Like... like Curious George

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.839
used to have a tail,
but now he doesn't.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:04.535
- What?
- "Used to"?

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.972
- Yeah. Look it up.
- No, it didn't change.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.425
- People just remember it wrong.
- Okay, but maybe it did change.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.193
- Maybe it did change.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:13.209
Curious George
does not have a tail?

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.413
- No.
- On it.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.422
My whole life's a lie.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.568
- This is freaking me out.
- You haven't heard about this?

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:22.084
- No.
- No, it's called the Mandela Effect.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.221
Millions of people thought
that Nelson Mandela

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.923
died in prison in the '80s,

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.443
- but he didn't.
- The theory is our reality

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.060
collided with a
parallel reality.

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.296
Right, right, right... Where
Kit Kat has no hyphen

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:33.134
and Curious George has no tail.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.366
Oh, okay.

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:36.033
Look, it's science, yo, okay?

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:38.354
- Quantum physics... look it up.
- "Quantum physics."

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.422
Do you guys seriously not
hear how ridiculous you sound?

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:41.971
Okay, but God had
Himself a human son

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.459
who could walk on
water and multiply fish,

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:44.974
and that's not ridiculous?

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:48.077
So, yeah, given the choice,
I'm taking the Kit Kat theory.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.951
And if we get lucky,
maybe we'll collide

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.548
with a reality where our school
isn't poisoned by Reverend Dave

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:55.025
- and his one truth.
- Preach it.

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.256
You just don't get it
'cause you're one of 'em, K.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.956
Not really.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.091
I mean, not anymore.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.327
Excuse me?

00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:05.333
- What?
- Okay, if-if you're not

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:07.669
one of them, then what are you?

00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:09.909
What am I?

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.033
I'm annoyed.

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:12.976
By you, because you're annoying.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.570
I have to go.

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.549
- Sorry, bro. I...
- Thanks, Teo.

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.314
It was a... conversation.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.151
It's okay.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:26.188
Keaton, wait up.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:27.652
Look, I didn't
mean anything by it.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:28.927
I know. It's fine.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.190
I have a chem test tomorrow.

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.424
- I have to study.
- We were just joking.

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:35.024
Keaton.

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.296
I don't care what you
believe and don't believe,

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:38.647
and I don't have a
problem with God.

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.230
Yeah, but you do, Adam.

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.659
Okay? You say
it's just the church

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.471
or religion or whatever, but...

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:48.945
You know, I am so tired of
having this same conversation

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:51.415
- over and over again with you.
- Yeah. Me, too.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.387
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.289
Okay?

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.095
I know.

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:04.630
Okay.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.302
I think I...

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.674
Think I just need
some time right now.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.204
On my own.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.678
What does that mean?

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.283
Just to figure things out.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.590
Are you serious?

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:33.216
No, come on.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.658
Don't...

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.626
Don't do that.

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.721
Keaton, please,
what are you doing?

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.693
Don't.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.559
I love you.

00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:46.035
I know.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:48.664
I love you. Don't do this.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.403
I'm sorry.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.182

Lord, we're broken people.

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.668
Please just bring
healing and restoration

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:41.251
to our school right now,

difficult time.

- Amen.

Have a good one.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.437
Hey.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:59.842
I know, I know. I've been M.I.A.

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:01.523
It's just been a
really crazy semester.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:03.140
Yeah, no, I-I totally get it.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.793
Well, look, you're...
you're more than welcome

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.479
to come down to
the city and work

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.214
on our habitat
project, if you want.

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.189
Cool. Yeah, I'll...
I'll definitely try.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.594
Did you know that there's
no hyphen in "Kit Kat"?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.258
You mean like Kit
Kat, the candy bar?

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.601
Yeah. You know what? Sorry.

00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:24.022
Forget it. I'm
being really weird.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.332
Hey.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.839
If you need to talk
about anything or...

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.541
whatever, I'm-I'm always here.

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:32.771
Thanks, but I'm fine, really.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.506
See ya.

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.766
See, this here is
why you should never

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.156
talk religion or politics, yo.

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.386
Dude, that's all you talk about.

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.157
Will you have Keaton text
me when you get back?

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:25.561
Oh, uh-uh.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:26.826
Leave me out of this.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.457
This one is on you, Adam.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.798
If she wants to text
you, she will text you.

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:36.833
All right, look, you
need to sleep it off, man.

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:38.274
All right?

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.640
- I'm fine.
- You good?

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:40.940
Yeah.

00:19:41.247 --> 00:19:42.772
All right, man,
we're going this way.

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:44.316
Later.

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.447
Yeah, right.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.367
Hey!

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:46.503
- Hey! Get back here!
- David!

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.410
David, no!

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:57.854
<i>The city was in shock</i>

00:20:57.957 --> 00:20:59.585
<i>late last night
when a tragic fire</i>

00:20:59.692 --> 00:21:01.354
<i>broke out at Saint James.</i>

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.894
<i>That is the controversial church</i>

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:05.692
on the campus of our very
own Hadleigh University.

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:07.562
Both police and fire departments

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:10.329
have not ruled out arson
in the fire that has claimed

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.428
the life of a visiting
pastor from Ghana,

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:13.904
Jude Mbaye.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.635
<i>Police and the FBI are
now treating the case</i>

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.904
<i>as a hate-crime homicide.</i>

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.537
Crowds have already started
to gather outside the church

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.343
to pay their respects.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:24.815
This is why a church

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:26.715
does not belong
on a state campus.

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:28.363
You're favoring one
religion over another,

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:29.548
of course people are angry.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.523
It just invites
violence like this.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.618
What else is it gonna
take for people to wake up?

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.110
<i>The church has brought
nothing but controversy</i>

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:42.426
to the school for
years. It's time.

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.504
Our enrollment is down 18%.

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:47.573
We stand to lose $15
million this year alone.

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:49.005
I am well aware of that,

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:51.800
but we can't pin all
of this on Saint James.

00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:53.812
Well, this university
is in the midst

00:21:53.913 --> 00:21:56.974
of an identity crisis, Tom,
because of Saint James.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:58.573
We're moving backwards.

00:21:58.684 --> 00:21:59.811
This is wrong.

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.411
The church is a
historic landmark.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.854
It was here before
the university.

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:06.858
Dave...

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:09.394
is a good man.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.397
What about Jude,
the one who died?

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:14.558
I'm sure he was a good man, too.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.102
Barbara, with all due respect,

00:22:17.403 --> 00:22:19.872
if we kick the church
off campus now

00:22:19.972 --> 00:22:21.565
after what just happened,

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:23.040
how do you think
that's gonna look?

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.743
We're gonna look bad
no matter what we do.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:29.543
But in the long run, this is
what's best for the students.

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:32.847
Okay.

00:22:32.952 --> 00:22:35.114
Tom... I think you should be

00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:36.855
the one to talk to
Reverend Dave.

00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:41.017
Dave is my friend.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:43.561
Exactly.

00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:09.479
♪ Glory, glory ♪

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.817

We love you.

<i>the same one</i>

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.084
that Peter, John and James spoke

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:52.892
on that one dark night
when all their hopes died

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:55.024
on that blood-stained Cross.

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:58.662
Weeping may last
through the night,

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:02.139
but joy cometh in the morning.

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.774
And the morning always comes.

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:09.781
♪ Yes, I'm going home to ♪

00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:16.880
♪ To live with Jesus ♪

00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:20.619
♪ Since I've laid ♪

00:24:20.726 --> 00:24:24.720

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:31.670
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.999
I'm sorry.

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:35.540
I never know what
to say at these things.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.132
Oh, it's okay.

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:39.507
I'll come by, and we
can discuss the details...

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.978
Construction plans,
repairs, all that.

00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:43.081
Yeah.

00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:45.879
Well... when you're ready.

00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:47.248
Okay? Don't rush.

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:49.181
Just come on by my office.

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.514
- Yeah, thanks, Tom.
- Yeah. Hang in there.

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:53.592
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:00.699
Jude spoke of you all the time.

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:04.031
His American brother.

00:25:04.136 --> 00:25:07.265
I thank God he wasn't
alone in his last moments.

00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:10.209
I'm sorry.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.705
This is not your fault.

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:18.546
God... He uses all
things for His good.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.551
You know this.

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.561
What does...?

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:34.258
I think that's what
Jude said to me.

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.296
Last thing he said to me.

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:38.594
Wh-What does that mean?

00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:41.799
It's hard to translate.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.639
In English, it
means basically...

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:49.010
"Always God is good.

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:53.677
And God is good always."

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:39.826
Hey.

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.128
Dave, what are you doing here?

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:44.898
Well, it's Saturday, isn't it?

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.734
I mean, people
still need to eat.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.880
Sorry, it's a little bit
light this week, but, uh...

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.605
well, everything in the
pantry was ruined, so...

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.202
I know. I heard. I'm so sorry.

00:26:54.313 --> 00:26:55.872
And Jude.

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:58.075
Oh, I can't believe it.

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:00.118
Thanks.

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:01.812
I'll be okay.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.149
You hungry?

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:05.281
How about I feed
you for a change?

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.019
Thanks, but, uh...

00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.151
rain check?

00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:10.889
Okay.

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:13.090
You know where to find me.

00:27:25.844 --> 00:27:26.937
Hey.

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:28.638
Dave.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.273
Thanks for coming in.

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.682
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.344
Sure.

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:38.317
Tom, this is insane.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.324
You're gonna use
this as an opportunity

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.917
to advance some
political agenda?

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.326
It's not about that.

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:45.954
You don't just
knock a church down

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:47.794
because of a little controversy.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.028
Look, the insurance
will cover the damage.

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.660
It won't cost the
university anything.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.864
It's not about
the money, either.

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.702
It's really not.

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.275
This makes no sense.

00:27:57.376 --> 00:27:59.368
We were attacked.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.670
I know.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.375
But, Dave, we're
worried about the school,

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.083
the welfare of the students.

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:08.177
There are a lot of factors here.

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.723
Look, I know you're upset.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:13.416
You have every right to be.

00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:15.091
I don't like this, either.

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:16.856
I hope you get that.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.864
It's all in there.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:30.237
This was my father's church.

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:34.306
I was baptized there.

00:28:34.413 --> 00:28:36.939
I spent my whole life there.

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:38.381
I know.

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.008
It's my home, Tom.

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.848
It's everything I have.

00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.288
And it's not for sale.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.359
I don't think you're
hearing me, Dave.

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:50.725
The board has decided.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.923
It's a done deal.

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.869
I'm sorry.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.802
<i>This is absurd.</i>

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:01.385
<i>They can just take
the church from us?</i>

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.841
- I mean, don't we own this land?
- Yes.

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:06.275
- So, how is this legal?
- Eminent domain.

00:29:06.378 --> 00:29:08.847
I studied property law
a bit in grad school.

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:11.314
As I understand it, the state
gave all public universities

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.783
complete autonomy
over eminent domain.

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:16.411
Which means Hadleigh
can legally force us to sell.

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:18.353
- Where are we supposed to go?
- And with what

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:20.201
they're offering, how can
we build anything anyway?

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:21.785
- Can we go to court?
- Another lawsuit?

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.761
- Really?
- I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:26.102
but we've burned through any
legal reserves and then some

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:28.638
- over the last few months.
- No land within 30 miles of here.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.178
We're out of money,
plain and simple.

00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:31.363
None that we can afford.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.837
I don't see that we
have an option here.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.106
You gonna be okay?

00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:50.255
All these years this
church has been here.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:53.883
When I think about the
work that God has done

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:56.826
and the lives that
He's changed...

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.131
Now it's just a crime scene.

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:11.309
You know, Keaton
stopped by the other day.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.276
Remember her?

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:17.008
First time I've seen
her in five months.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:19.016
She's lost.

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:21.951
She needs someone to walk
with her right where she's at.

00:30:22.054 --> 00:30:24.046
There are hundreds
more like her.

00:30:24.156 --> 00:30:26.921
- Here.
- I know, Josh. I got it, but...

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.536
This is why I took on
Professor Radisson,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.859
why I left law school
for this ministry.

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:34.399
Because what we do
and how we do it, it...

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.092
it's important, Dave.

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:38.466
Josh, we have no
money, no lawyers.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.129
If I could do
something, I would.

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:42.139
It's just... it's not that easy.

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.141
No, it's not easy.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:48.372
But it's simple.

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:52.108
Look, I, uh...

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:55.312
I hate to quote
scripture to a pastor,

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.184
but, um...

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.588
you remember Luke 12:48?

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:03.325
Seems like you're the one

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:05.090
much is being
asked of this time.

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:12.101
If you decide you
want to fight this,

00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.901
pretty sure God will
handle the details.

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.540
And I'll be right
here beside you.

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:18.162
<i>You've got an apartment?</i>

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.136
Okay, apartment "E"?

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:22.707
Thank you.

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:24.285
Okay, don't you worry about it.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.607
I know. Thank you, Pearce.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.269
I swear Mike's a good kid.

00:32:27.379 --> 00:32:29.457
He's just really struggling
right now, with his friends.

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:31.507
- He's just caught up...
- What are you doing here?

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.085
Dad's church.

00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:43.992
You'd hardly even recognize it.

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:46.360
Hey, look, this is a
property law case.

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.127
It's not really my thing.

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:50.395
Pearce, you're a
social justice attorney.

00:32:50.502 --> 00:32:52.246
They're forcing us out
because we're a church.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.205
This is exactly your thing.

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.436
Let me get this
straight... You drive

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.273
all the way up here,
you don't even call.

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:02.006
Were you afraid I'd say no?

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.673
I didn't know what
you'd say, to be honest.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.975
Look, I have a little money.

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.644
I don't want your money.

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.551
This is a legit offer.

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.180
Thing goes to trial,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.035
jury will probably give
you half that amount.

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:15.254
Less even.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.760
Money aside...

00:33:17.062 --> 00:33:19.054
these things always get messy.

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.292
God called me to fight.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.426
I'm gonna fight.

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:27.301
Aw... God calls
you, you call me.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.252
- Did you see that? Uh-huh.
- Right in the third position.

00:33:31.276 --> 00:33:33.040
Third position?

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.675
Adam, what's up,
baby? Where you been?

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.253
Can I talk to you?

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.133
What do I do?

00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:02.065
What do I do?

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:05.333
I don't know what to do.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:16.145
<i>Hey, I appreciate
you coming down.</i>

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.314
<i>I know you're
busy. It's a lot to ask.</i>

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:19.755
<i>Sure.</i>

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:27.760
Wow. Look at this place.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:29.557
It got smaller.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.366
What'd you do to the tree?

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:37.305
Huh?

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.537
What's wrong with it?

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:41.636
For one thing, it's dead.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.385
I figured you could
take your old room.

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:51.115
It's kind of a guest room
and some storage, but...

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.689
Wow.

00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:57.285
Got the old man's chair.

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.591
Allowed to sit in it now?

00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:12.143
Sorry to hear about your friend.

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:14.769
Yeah. Thanks.

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:16.745
I'm okay.

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.608
You know, that's...

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:23.712
what you said at Mom's
funeral: "I'm okay."

00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:26.348
Somebody burns your church down,

00:35:26.458 --> 00:35:28.654
kills your friend,
but you're okay.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.854
What do you want
me to say, Pearce?

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.858
Yes, I'm having a hard time.

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:35.224
Just doing my
best to get through.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.621
You want something to drink?

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:39.160
You got booze?

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.738
No.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.412
Did you buy three
boxes of these for me?

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.609
Of course.

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.549
I knew you'd come.

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:57.282
Unfortunately, I don't
really eat Zingers anymore.

00:35:57.389 --> 00:35:58.899
What do you mean,
you don't eat Zingers?

00:35:58.923 --> 00:35:59.923
You love those things.

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:01.386
What happened?

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:02.859
Triple bypass.

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.561
Heart surgery?

00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:06.256
You had heart surgery?

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:09.198
- Six years ago.
- I had no idea.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.791
Why would you?

00:36:12.604 --> 00:36:14.630
Well, we're all caught up.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:17.299
And I'm gonna
hit the hay. Night.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.606
Night.

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:36.237
Eminent domain precedent cases

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:38.787
having to do with churches
specifically would be best.

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:41.196
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:43.495
Well, just take the
meeting without me, Todd.

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:45.797
No, I realize that,
but it's a family thing.

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:48.499
What do you want me to say?

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.541
Just make sure everything
has the same zip.

00:36:50.642 --> 00:36:52.508
Okay? Okay, thanks.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.238
Make yourself at home.

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.610
- You doing all right?
- I'll tell you what.

00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.707
You stop asking me, and
I'll stop saying I'm okay.

00:36:58.817 --> 00:37:00.410
Fair enough.

00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:03.654
Ready to get to it?

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:06.452
I've been getting
to it since 5:00 a.m.

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:08.652
Okay? I'm starving.
There's nothing in that fridge

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.662
but moldy casseroles.
Is Doe's still open?

00:37:11.763 --> 00:37:13.629
- I guess.
- Well, let's go.

00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:14.995
Don't eat that.

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.733
<i>The government
takes private property.</i>

00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:19.896
<i>They do it all the time.</i>

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.666
End of story.

00:37:21.773 --> 00:37:24.436
How do you think highways
and railroads get built, man?

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.272
But this isn't about a railroad.

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:29.006
They said they need the land
to build a new student union.

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:30.543
I hardly think that qualifies.

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.877
We'll see. It might.

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:33.884
You're not hearing me.

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.629
They just want the church
gone because they think

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:37.679
it's bad PR for the university.

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:39.280
Yeah, they're probably right.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.291
- Pearce.
- Hey, listen, man.

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.793
I said this ain't my thing.

00:37:43.895 --> 00:37:45.557
All right? Now
you want to tell me

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:47.063
how to fight an
eminent domain case?

00:37:47.332 --> 00:37:48.493
Why don't I just go home?

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.693
You can do it.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.715
This is eerie.

00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:08.746
Let's go check it out.

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:10.822
Can't. It's all locked up.

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.807
Last time I was
in this building,

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:36.814
Dad was standing right there.

00:38:57.368 --> 00:38:58.802
Hey.

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:03.407
You got in so much
trouble for that.

00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:06.842
So stupid.

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.981
I'm gonna write a letter
to the board of trustees

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.713
and introduce myself
as your legal counsel.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.814
I'll politely let them know we
won't be entertaining any more

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:23.588
backroom offers
between old friends.

00:39:26.898 --> 00:39:28.594
Thank you.

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:32.463
One step at a
time, little brother.

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:36.006
<i>His brother is a lawyer?</i>

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.507
Are you kidding me?

00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:39.009
Of course he's gonna fight back.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.840
What'd you expect?

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:43.938
At least we can offer him
a... a better settlement.

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.710
Something more fair.

00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:47.581
And where do we
take that money from?

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.125
To pay any more
than legally required

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.712
is a disservice to the school.

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:53.553
Not to mention, it's unethical.

00:39:53.658 --> 00:39:56.127
Be careful not to
let your friendship

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:58.419
with Reverend Dave
cloud your judgment.

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:01.124
Look, I'm on your side.

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:04.664
My advice is take
care of this now.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:07.136
Or the person who
replaces you will.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.053
<i>And it's important to remember,</i>

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.602
<i>in the midst of all
this controversy,</i>

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.442
<i>that friends and
family are now grieving</i>

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:18.516
<i>the death of this innocent man</i>

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.108
<i>killed in this tragic
and senseless way.</i>

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:22.910
<i>I can't even imagine
the heartbreak</i>

00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:24.717
<i>for his parents having to...</i>

00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:41.937
<i>Maybe you just need to stop</i>

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.442
- thinking about it.
- I can't.

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.068
How can I?

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.048
Everybody thinks...

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.142
that he was...

00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.717
murdered.

00:40:56.821 --> 00:41:01.054
His... his friends,
his... his parents.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:02.718
They deserve to
know the truth...

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.227
That it was an accident.

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:07.499
Maybe it'll help them.

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.543
Maybe that'll... that'll
give them some sort of...

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.899
- But...
- closure.

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:14.905
- I don't know.
- Okay, okay, so say you confess.

00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:17.669
Maybe they'll go
easy on you, but...

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.004
maybe they won't.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.477
Okay, and then what?

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.209
I don't know.

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:32.023
Do you really believe...

00:41:33.091 --> 00:41:35.686
that there's a God?

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.496
I don't know.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.125
I guess.

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.898
If He does exist...

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.941
do you think that
He would forgive me?

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:00.245
Of course.

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.871
Hey, Pearce, I'm
headed to church.

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:25.102
You want to join?

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:27.007
Not one bit.

00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:32.181
Look what I found.

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:33.842
What?

00:42:34.986 --> 00:42:36.249
Check it out.

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.920
My gosh.

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.218
Wait, wait, wait. I want
to show you something.

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:41.917
Oh, man.

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:53.562
Stretchy!

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:56.106
Wow.

00:42:56.207 --> 00:42:57.698
I thought most of this stuff

00:42:57.809 --> 00:42:59.573
would've ended up in a landfill.

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.305
- No.
- Hey.

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.648
Pearce, Aunt Celia painted that.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.651
Who cares? It's ugly.

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:10.017
- Bet you can't hit the frog.
- Grow up.

00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:11.851
Ten bucks.

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.754
Give it to me.

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:20.624
Told you.

00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:27.763
Wow. Mandy Stebbins.

00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:30.637
- Whatever happened to her?
- I don't know.

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.733
If she's not on
Facebook, I have no idea.

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:34.845
Hey.

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:38.683
Confirmation.

00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:41.882
You still pray for me?

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.887
Pearce, can we not?

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.617
Why? I'm just curious.

00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:50.021
Yeah. Sometimes.

00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:51.152
I knew it.

00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:52.890
What do you pray for?

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:55.057
I'll come back around,
I'll find peace? What?

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.211
- Is this fun for you?
- I'm just making conversation.

00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:58.931
Yeah, well, maybe
I'll pray that you make

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:01.870
better conversation.

00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:03.635
Josh?

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:06.176
Wha...? Right now?

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.772
Hey, I'm gonna need the name

00:44:10.882 --> 00:44:12.192
- of a circuit judge down here.
- Whoa. -Whoa.

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:14.242
Yes. Now. Today.

00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:16.014
- Okay, let me know.
- Dave! -Yeah.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.419
- What... what's going on?
- They won't stop.

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:20.089
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:44:20.191 --> 00:44:21.784
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:44:21.893 --> 00:44:23.794
- Stop! Stop!
- Hey. I need you on the other

00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:26.106
- side of the tape, sir.
- I'm the pastor of this church.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.962
Well, that may
be, but it's not safe.

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:29.985
- It's okay. I'm his attorney.
- Congratulations.

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:32.229
And I'm a Mets fan.
Now, move back,

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:34.328
- or I call the cops.
- Already called 'em.

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:35.997
Hey, buddy, I have
a demo permit.

00:44:36.107 --> 00:44:38.235
You got a permit to wreck
a church on a Sunday?

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.386
- Really?
- Yeah, what can I say?

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.021
Signed by the president
of the university.

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:42.775
"Thomas Ellsworth."

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.145
- Unbelievable.
- Just trying to do my job here.

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:47.718
Yeah, and I'm trying to do
mine. Give me your keys.

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.396
You touch this church
before I get back, I'll have you

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.355
arrested for destruction
of property, okay?

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.684
You stay put.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.070
Yeah, what do you want me to do?

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.158
I don't know. Stall.

00:44:57.929 --> 00:45:00.330
- You have a Bible?
- Yeah.

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:03.143
<i>Yeah, yeah, Gloria Pascual.</i>

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.167
<i>I know.</i>

00:45:04.202 --> 00:45:05.795
I'm already on my way.

00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:09.099
What? Are you kidding me?

00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:13.409
Of course she is. It's Sunday.

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.735
Where is she?

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.108
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know it.</i>

00:45:16.214 --> 00:45:17.842
<i>I know it.</i>

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:19.178
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.979
We're gonna hold service.

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:22.849
Right now.

00:45:22.954 --> 00:45:23.994
Come on in, guys. Come on.

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:25.751
Come on over here.

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.188
Can I have that Bible?

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:28.384
Yeah, yeah.

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.926
Said some kind of lawyer.

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.393
So the, uh...

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:35.125
the Bible is the Word of God.

00:45:35.233 --> 00:45:38.294
But how often do we
really take time to read it?

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:40.132
Let's start at the
top, shall we?

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.798
- "In the beginning..."
- Oh, man.

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:44.808
<i>They haven't even filed yet.</i>

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:47.003
<i>No appraisals, no
escrow deposits.</i>

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:48.909
<i>It's an old-fashioned
end around.</i>

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:50.504
Hold on.

00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:55.886
You still there? You still
gotta send me the injunction.

00:45:55.987 --> 00:45:57.387
Yeah, PDF's fine.

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.013
Okay, hurry up.

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.819
Hey, hey, hey! I-I
don't even know

00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:02.325
what she looks like.

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.861
The judge! Who do you
think I'm talking about?

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:07.022
Yeah, send me a pic.

00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.989
<i>"The serpent</i>

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:35.992
"was more crafty than
any of the wild animals

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.356
"the Lord God had made.

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:38.952
"And he said to the woman,

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:40.998
"" Did God really
say you must not eat

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.043
from the tree in any garden? ""

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.508
Your Honor, I am so
sorry, but I'm an attorney,

00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:57.509
and it's important
that I speak with you.

00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:00.910
I'm in the middle of Mass.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.045
I'm aware. It's...
it's very timely.

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:05.521
It involves a church.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:07.314
<i>And we want to take you</i>

00:47:07.425 --> 00:47:08.984
live to the scene right now,

00:47:09.093 --> 00:47:11.221
show you what is
developing as we speak.

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.006
<i>You are looking here
at Saint James Church.</i>

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.908
<i>This is on the campus of
Hadleigh University now.</i>

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:18.266
<i>Local pastor, David
Hill, is basically staging</i>

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:21.237
<i>his very own version of what
can only be described here</i>

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:23.501
<i>as a Senate filibuster.</i>

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:25.367
<i>His last-ditch effort
to delay the demolition</i>

00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:26.536
<i>of his church.</i>

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.073
"When it came to pass..."

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:29.859
<i>As you can see here,
he's literally reading</i>

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:32.348
<i>the Bible cover to cover
while the growing crowds</i>

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:33.611
<i>watch and wait.</i>

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:35.045
Yeah, that's him.

00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:37.485
Your little stunt's gonna
cost you and the pastor

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.318
- a night in jail.
- Well, I don't think so.

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:43.053
I have a signed injunction
from Judge Pascual that says...

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.992
Well, you can read it yourself.

00:47:45.096 --> 00:47:47.395
"Cease and desist."

00:47:50.368 --> 00:47:52.030
Good?

00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:54.105
- Thank you.
- Let's go!

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.121
All right, guys, we're done.

00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:03.080
Time to leave. Let's go.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.273
What happened?

00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:06.112
I just bought us three weeks.

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.879
Thank you.

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.296
<i>So, maybe the university's</i>

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.084
board of trustees
does have the right

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.918
to expropriate the
church property.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.651
But even if it's
legal, is it moral?

00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:16.655
Just take a look at
their dilemma here.

00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:18.401
This is no longer
a Christian school.

00:48:18.496 --> 00:48:20.296
The church really should
have moved off campus

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:23.163
50 years ago when the
state bought the university.

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.930
Instead, funding is
given disproportionately

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:27.504
to one religious organization

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.369
while other ones
are being denied.

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.966
So you add that to all of this
controversy and now violence.

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:35.273
You tell me... How
can they justify

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:37.314
keeping the church on campus?

00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:40.408
Thomas Ellsworth is
making the right choice here.

00:48:40.518 --> 00:48:43.454
It's not the easy one,
but it is the right choice.

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:46.046
<i>I think their intentions
are pretty clear.</i>

00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:48.422
Enough with writing
letters. Let's call 'em out.

00:48:48.526 --> 00:48:50.427
Call 'em out on what, stupidity?

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:51.928
Why are you so
reluctant to accept

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.573
- what's really going on?
- Unbelievable.

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:56.260
You guys love to play
the victim card, don't you?

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:58.063
- "You guys."
- Look, forget it.

00:48:58.169 --> 00:49:00.331
I'm not engaging in a
false narrative with you.

00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:02.066
I'm just... I'm not.

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:03.483
It undermines true
religious liberty.

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:05.703
You're talking to a
guy who went to jail

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.187
who's now having
his church stolen.

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:08.321
How is that false narrative?

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.075
Because it's never that simple.

00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:13.242
The Christian Church has a
long history of persecuting people,

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.682
and then those people push back,

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:17.250
and you guys want to cry victim.

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:19.050
And for every example of someone

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:21.455
who's misrepresented
Jesus for some twisted reason,

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:24.256
there are a hundred others
who have done good in His name.

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:26.421
We can debate
history all you want,

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.591
but I'm talking about now,
about getting my church back.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.532
Can you just help me do that?

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.331
I'm right here, aren't I?

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:35.633
Just don't drag me into
your personal crusade.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:39.705
Where you going?

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.376
I'm going to bed.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.294
- Thank you, Pastor.
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:48.438
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:49.647
Okay.

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:52.387
Okay.

00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:58.027
Pastor Dave.

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.687
Keaton, how are you?

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.330
I'm okay.

00:50:02.433 --> 00:50:04.334
So, how's stuff going
with the the church?

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:06.495
Have they found
the person who did it?

00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:08.698
Not yet. They're
still investigating.

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:12.204
Oh, I just figured, like,
fingerprints or whatever.

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:14.710
Oh, it's not quite
like the movies.

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:18.107
It takes time, but I'm
sure they'll catch 'em.

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:21.151
What's gonna happen
when they find 'em?

00:50:21.252 --> 00:50:25.519
Put 'em away, I
hope, for a long time.

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:30.084
<i>The order's good
for three weeks.</i>

00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:32.129
Can't be much longer than that.

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.697
Hey, what do you want me to say?

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.789
He's my brother.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.228
Do me a favor...
Send me some briefs

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:41.772
for <i>Kelo v. New
London</i> and... what else?

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:44.667
<i>Faith Temple, uh, v. Brighton.</i>

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:46.073
Okay, thanks.

00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:12.379
Really, take it with you.
It's getting cold out there.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:13.427
All right, bye.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:15.199
- Thank you.
- Smells good.

00:51:15.306 --> 00:51:17.366
- Mm-hmm. -Smells good.

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:19.705
Coming to collect
on that rain check.

00:51:21.779 --> 00:51:23.714
You guys close growing up?

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:27.216
Yeah. That's why it was so hard.

00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:29.219
Pearce was my hero.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.846
I mean, he had
this strong faith.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.182
But he was so cool about it.

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:36.260
He made Christianity cool.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.226
Yeah, I know the type.

00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:41.231
Went off to law school
when I started college.

00:51:41.332 --> 00:51:42.664
And then something happened.

00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:44.359
I don't know, he changed.

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:46.130
How?

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:47.761
Uh...

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:51.239
I don't know, I guess he
was struggling in his faith.

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:53.277
But it was more
than just confusion.

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:55.471
It was darker than that.

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.343
I always hoped that
he'd come around

00:51:57.448 --> 00:52:00.111
before our parents died.

00:52:01.819 --> 00:52:03.879
It was hard on them.

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:06.521
Felt like they lost their son.

00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:08.593
You lost your hero.

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:10.456
Yeah.

00:52:10.561 --> 00:52:12.120
Guess I did.

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:19.358
That's amazing, isn't it?

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:20.699
That he can look at that...

00:52:23.374 --> 00:52:25.138
and see that.

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:32.249
You okay?

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.286
I feel a little bit
like I'm drifting.

00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:39.817
Keep trying to tell
myself all the things

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:43.451
that I would tell others
who are struggling.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.358
It's not helping.

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:48.694
Think I might be bad at my job.

00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:50.768
I doubt that.

00:52:50.868 --> 00:52:53.861
I just want to get back
to the way things were.

00:52:55.406 --> 00:52:56.772
How far back is that?

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:01.368
I mean, going back
doesn't really work.

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:02.946
And believe me, I've tried.

00:53:03.247 --> 00:53:06.479
I've gone back to
school, gone back home,

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.246
back to brunette.

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.881
But I've never been able to
go back to the way things were.

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.857
I hope you're wrong.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.227
'Cause if I can't go back,
I don't know where to go.

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.208
Are you doing okay?

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.834
I told you to stop
asking me that.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.310
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.278
<i>So, how much?</i>

00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:39.373
How much what?

00:53:39.483 --> 00:53:41.281
We made you an offer.

00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:44.219
You're here to
counter, so counter.

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:46.256
Oh, believe me, I wish I could.

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:47.847
Unfortunately,
despite my counsel,

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:50.518
my client is not
interested in money.

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:51.771
So, what is your
client interested in?

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.696
- I want my church back.
- Dave...

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:54.890
be reasonable.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.876
Reason went out the window,
Tom, when you brought

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.459
a demolition crew
to my front door.

00:53:58.569 --> 00:53:59.867
Look, a college campus

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.734
is about education,
not religion.

00:54:01.839 --> 00:54:02.898
We've got limited space.

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.668
We need to maximize
it for every student.

00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:06.820
None of that gives you the
right to tear my church down.

00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:09.006
- Well, actually it does.
- Dana, stop.

00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:11.339
We're wasting our time here.

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.679
We both know that this
meeting was simply a courtesy.

00:54:13.784 --> 00:54:15.878
And, Barbara, we appreciate it.

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:17.614
It's very courteous.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.589
I get it. It's a
prime piece of land.

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:23.024
You know what
I'd do if it were me?

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:25.796
I'd put in a big student center
with a fancy coffee shop.

00:54:25.896 --> 00:54:27.330
The kids would love it.

00:54:27.431 --> 00:54:29.263
I mean, to me,
that's more valuable

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.494
than a dusty old
church. No offense.

00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.571
But he knows
how I feel about it.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.468
Here's the problem.

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.269
What you're doing,
it's against the law.

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:41.470
'Cause eminent domain
doesn't automatically apply

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:44.844
just because you guys
don't like his church.

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:47.349
So, here's my counter.

00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:49.716
Withdraw your claim, or we sue.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.654
See what a judge
has to say about it.

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.884
We're done.

00:54:58.562 --> 00:55:00.690
This case will never
make it to court.

00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.091
They didn't look
worried, Pearce.

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:16.644
Oh, they are.
That's their job...

00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:18.340
To not look worried.

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.713
Listen, we gotta change
the conversation in the media.

00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:22.878
Okay, we gotta put a
face to the opposition.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:25.751
- Tom?
- Yeah, Tom.

00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:27.700
He's the most visible.
He's got the most to lose.

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:28.724
You okay with that?

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:30.785
I'll just tell the truth.

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:33.762
People need to
know what he's doing.

00:55:33.864 --> 00:55:35.833
Good boy. Let's go.

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:41.095
But Saint James built
Hadleigh University years ago.

00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:43.965
Exactly. So you see
how far this has gone.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.475
And now, with the
school board's actions,

00:55:46.577 --> 00:55:49.547
we've been given no choice
but to seek a legal solution.

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:51.424
All of these college
administrators,

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.917
they go on and on
and on about diversity

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.645
and tolerance and inclusion,

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:57.448
but yet, when
it's asked of them,

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.455
they run you off of campus.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.650
That doesn't sound very
tolerant or inclusive to me.

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.454
Tom Ellsworth is
trying to strip away

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.240
the foundational
element of this university

00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:08.490
because he believes that
it is no longer convenient.

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:10.067
But truth isn't
about convenience.

00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:12.359
And faith in God may not be

00:56:12.469 --> 00:56:14.631
as popular on
campus as it once was,

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:16.366
but people still have a right...

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:19.966
A fundamental human
right to express their beliefs,

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.603
even in a public square
at a state university.

00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:25.979
If you agree, we're asking that
you make your voices heard.

00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:27.517
Send an e-mail.

00:56:27.618 --> 00:56:29.052
Make a call.

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.644
Let Tom Ellsworth and
the university board know

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:35.419
that you believe the
church still has value.

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:37.245
The gauntlet has been thrown.

00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:39.454
And we'll see how
people respond.

00:56:39.563 --> 00:56:41.623
Dude, almost
three million views.

00:56:41.732 --> 00:56:43.894
People are mad. This is good.

00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:45.902
Does this buy us the
leverage we need?

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:48.996
Well, we'll find
out at the prelim.

00:56:49.106 --> 00:56:51.575
Need the judge to let
us argue the case, but...

00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:53.405
this all helps.

00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:56.709
Nice work.

00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:59.113
Thanks.

00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:01.995
I think it's time for me

00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:03.453
to get back preaching again.

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:04.831
I'm afraid I'm
getting so caught up

00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:06.050
in all this, I just...

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:08.091
I don't want to lose sight
of my work, you know.

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.057
Well, let me know
when and where.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.026
I'll be there for sure.

00:57:12.129 --> 00:57:14.030
Hey, we're back.

00:57:14.131 --> 00:57:16.566
- Oh, I turned it off.
- What?

00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:18.727
Don't you want to see
if they get the diamond?

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:21.730
Don't you knock?

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.534
- What are you doing?
- I'm on the phone.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.903
Who you talking to so late?

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:26.533
None of your business.

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:28.475
Is that Pearce?
Tell him I said hi.

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:29.773
Meg says hi.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.212
Hi, Meg.

00:57:31.515 --> 00:57:32.515
Uh, let me call you back.

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.016
Ooh, what's the deal there?

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:36.518
There's no deal.
She's a friend of mine.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.953
She runs one of the
ministries we support.

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:42.686
- What do you want, Pearce?
- Nothing.

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:44.762
- Is that my shirt?
- Yeah.

00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:02.912
What are you doing?

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:05.505
I told you, this tree's dead.
It's gonna fall on the house.

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.174
I didn't ask you to cut it down.

00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:09.646
- I can do it myself.
- Can you, now?

00:58:09.753 --> 00:58:11.051
Yeah, I could.

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:13.214
Go for it.

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:14.923
All right, fine.

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.526
You might want to back up.

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.526
- Gotta do better than that.
- It was a warm-up.

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:32.802
Still warming up?

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:41.961
Careful with that
weak heart of yours.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.214
Ha ha. Funny guy.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.579
Watch this.

00:58:44.688 --> 00:58:46.714
Get ready to yell "timber."

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:49.088
I got a better idea.

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.890
Oh, now we're talking.

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.020
Yeah!

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:06.641
- Okay, give it a push.
- All right, hold up.

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:08.905
- Tell me when you're ready.
- Yeah.

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:10.173
Go.

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:13.016
Ah, we almost got it!

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:16.815
Oh! Yeah!

00:59:19.156 --> 00:59:20.647
Yes!

00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:28.232
Just promise me you'll
plant something new here.

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.232
Mom liked pomegranate trees.

00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:36.706
Do you even believe in
what we're fighting for?

00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:40.904
Do I believe in your right
to keep your church? Yes.

00:59:41.011 --> 00:59:44.675
But the rest of it...
You know the answer.

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.841
So, why help me?

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.748
What do you think
I do for a living?

00:59:48.852 --> 00:59:50.821
Do you think I need to
have the belief system

00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:53.891
of every crackhead I
defend to defend 'em?

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.959
So religion has no value

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.221
except for the
laws that protect it?

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.593
Value? I don't know.

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:02.359
But people have evolved.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:04.760
Science has
replaced superstition.

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:07.269
Church has outlived
its usefulness.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:10.807
- Wow.
- Okay, I don't expect you to agree, but...

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.218
that's okay, 'cause
this is healthy.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.733
It's a healthy discourse.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.335
Pearce, people are broken.

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.204
They're-they're... they're lost.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:20.716
They're searching...
For meaning, for purpose.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.945
Oh, church is the answer
to those problems, huh?

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.919
Church is a place
for people to seek.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:28.082
To grapple with those
difficult questions.

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:31.286
To find hope and... and truth.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.097
And you know that.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.291
Or at least you used to.

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.800
Why do you need me to agree
with you about everything?

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.768
I'm just your lawyer.

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:43.067
I didn't come here
to debate religion

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:44.869
or do your landscaping.

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:47.971
But, man, you're
my little brother.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:51.105
And I don't like to see
people push you around.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.706
And that's why I'm helping you.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.412
And right now, that answer's
gotta be good enough for you.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.314
<i>Now, this whole situation</i>

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.325
brings you to the Cross.

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:07.420
And the Cross is both
vertical and horizontal.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.427
Vertical is me and God.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:11.827
God and me... My
relationship with Christ.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.904
The horizontal
part... you and I.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.303
Sometimes we get so
caught up in the vertical,

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.240
we forget the horizontal,
forget each other.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.674
Yeah, but it's... it's at

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.954
the intersection
where Jesus comes in.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.708
- Yes.
- That nexus... and that's

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.749
where Paul's words are so
powerful and compelling...

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.910
Even Jews and gentiles
are fellow citizens.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.989
<i>So, with all the noise and
anger out there right now,</i>

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:34.114
<i>it's peace that we
have to think about.</i>

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:35.692
<i>And it's gonna
require one thing,</i>

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.260
<i>and it's gonna
require sacrifice.</i>

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.352
<i>At the end of the
day, we can't forget</i>

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.397
<i>that Christ's
forgiveness came about</i>

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.132
<i>via the conduit
of the sacrifice.</i>

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:46.726
<i>And we are called, believe
it or not, to do the same.</i>

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:01.042
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.118
How are you?

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.482
Mm, been better.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:18.198
Do you know why my
mom divorced my dad?

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.305
He used to beat her.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.968
I was nine...

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.304
when she left him.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.219
You know what our church did?

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.456
They called her a sinner.

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:42.984
They said that if
she married again

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.358
she'd be an adulterer.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.492
They humiliated her.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.232
What I remember
most about that time

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:56.033
is the sound of my mother
crying herself to sleep.

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.370
I'm so sorry. I...

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.538
So yeah, I get angry sometimes.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:09.147
But I didn't... I didn't mean
for anybody to get hurt.

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:11.221
I know you didn't.

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:20.386
For what it's worth,
I prayed about it.

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.161
And?

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:29.095
No answer.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.943
And did you believe him?

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:38.174
Of course I believed him.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.374
I was seven years old.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.178
I believed whatever he told me.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.844
"Dave, you can
make your own 7 Up.

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:45.444
"All you need is...

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.524
is just water and salt."

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:51.070
- And did you drink it?
- It was terrible, obviously.

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:53.825
But I kept adding
more and more salt,

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.059
just waiting for
those little bubbles.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.102
Oh, the poor guy.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.866
He drank the whole bottle...
Two liters of salt water.

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.873
But I gotta hand it to Pearce.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:08.172
He, uh... he waited by
my bedside all night long

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:10.179
to make sure that I didn't die.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.182
Yeah. That's what brothers
do. They look out for each other.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:15.218
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear, brother.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.547
Thank you.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.253
I really thought
you were gonna die.

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:22.017
Hadleigh University
is being flooded

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.117
with calls and e-mails
from angry citizens,

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:27.061
and it seems Chancellor
Ellsworth, well,

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.859
taking the brunt of that anger.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.411
Kayla's asking for
her bedtime story.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.574
Don't answer it, Tom.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.218
Hello?

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.351
Hello!

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:00.327
Hel... Stop calling me.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.125
- What was that?
- Stay here, stay here.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.224
What?

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.928
Daddy!

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:09.005
Kayla! Come here, baby.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.174
What was that?

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.485
Go on upstairs.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:27.014
It's okay, baby.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.648
It's okay.

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.490
I'm very proud of you.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.155
Of me?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.029
For what?

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:41.002
I get the feeling fighting's
not really your thing.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.437
But it's important
what you're doing.

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.032
It's inspiring.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.172
I was just thinking
about that sculptor

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.443
chiseling away at that rock.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:57.653
It's okay to be broken, Dave.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.049
It means God's
still shaping you.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:02.989
I'm honored to be a part of it.

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:09.958
- Tom?
- I'm getting death threats, Dave.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.695
Somebody threw a
brick through my window.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.481
- Okay, just take it easy, okay?
- No, Kayla could've been hurt!

01:06:15.505 --> 01:06:16.881
I don't know anything
about that. I'm sorry.

01:06:16.905 --> 01:06:17.149
No, no.

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.732
- You did this!
- Hey, hey.

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:21.711
Pearce!

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.343
Hey!

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.110
Get off him!

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:34.052
You brought the
fight to us, Tom.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.302
I'll get you some ice.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:49.067
You all right?

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.607
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.315
Maybe we should
just call it a night.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.611
Yeah. Uh...

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.583
I'll just get my stuff.

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:12.107
I didn't realize Tom
was a psychopath.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.664
Well, he's just scared.

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:19.061
Thanks.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.728
Way to impress
the lady, by the way.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.768
Well, it's kind of
my signature move.

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.201
Invite a girl over, and then
get punched in the face.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.141
Works every time.

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.042
Let's see.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.516
Ow. What'd you do that for?

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:37.686
You'll be all right.

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.251
Cottonwood Christian Center

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.827
v. Cypress Redevelopment Agency?

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:46.472
I got that. Give
me something else.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.040
Hey, I've got
some leftover pizza.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.158
Yeah.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:52.395
Josh, you're a smart kid.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:53.782
Why'd you give up on law school?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.510
Well, I wouldn't
say I gave up on it.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.200
Um, once I spent time
on a college campus,

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:00.334
I realized there was
a real need there.

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.555
You know, ministry's just
another way for me to serve.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.172
What kind of law
were you studying?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.079
Same as you... civil
rights, social justice.

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.209
Really? 'Cause you
don't strike me as a liberal.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:10.787
Give the kid a break.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.350
- What?
- I don't think

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:13.615
standing up for the oppressed

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.556
is exclusive to a
political agenda.

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:17.217
Well, let me ask you this.

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:19.626
Do you think that
your religious beliefs

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.823
get in the way of
real social change?

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.123
No, my... my beliefs are
the foundation of change.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:27.203
The belief that every human
is made in the image of God.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:29.423
I mean, Jesus was the
ultimate social justice warrior.

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:30.952
He said the lives
of children mattered

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:33.837
and regarded women
with honor and dignity

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:36.322
in a cultural moment where a
woman's testimony wasn't even

01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:37.871
permissible in a court of law.

01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:39.725
He consistently stood
up for the mistreated

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.650
and the marginalized.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.515
Well, I've been
doing this a long time,

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.940
and I wish I'd seen those
words put into action more often.

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.384
Yeah. Me, too.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.152
We're all responsible
for our part,

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.749
but it's grace and then justice,

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.351
not the other way around.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.488
Whether you serve
the court or the Lord,

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:57.328
you should follow the
example of Jesus because...

01:08:57.433 --> 01:09:00.130
without grace as
our goal, we're just...

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.436
you know, we're just fighting.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:02.766
Amen.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:05.137
Let's say grace.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.574
Dear Lord: Thank
you for this day.

01:09:07.677 --> 01:09:09.441
Thank you for this food.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.275
Bless it to our bodies,
and forgive Pearce

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:13.145
for eating before grace.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:15.343
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.647
That's not funny.

01:09:19.489 --> 01:09:21.617
<i>So, if the judge
agrees to let us</i>

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:23.590
<i>go to trial, do we have a shot?</i>

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.559
If we go to trial,
we're gonna win.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.426
Public's on our side,
jury's on our side.

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.499
- What if the judge says no?
- Then we're done.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:31.227
Great.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:35.599
- Am I allowed to talk in there?
- Please don't.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:37.585
You know, I've been
thinking... I like this Meg.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.871
She's the good kind
of Christian... authentic.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.736
You ought to seal the
deal before she gets wise.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.313
It's not exactly great timing.

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:47.546
Maybe I don't want
to rush into things.

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:49.414
Try not to end up
with two ex-wives.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:51.385
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.319
It's three now.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.517
Three?

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.436
Hadleigh offered a sum
that's fair market value

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.861
- for the property.
- It's perfectly fair.

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:03.592
But Saint James' value can't
be measured only in dollars.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.878
The court has no standard
for determining intrinsic value.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.236
Your Honor, Saint James
has had a positive impact

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.829
on this community
for generations.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.774
The university concedes the
plaintiff is not without merit,

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:16.607
but we question the
relevancy to this case.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:17.713
May I say something?

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.749
Well, you brought the lawsuit.

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:21.818
If you want to assess
the value of the church

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:24.547
to this community,
just turn on the news.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:28.318
The community is
speaking... Loudly.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.890
<i>This is what victory feels like.</i>

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.826
We're going to court.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:35.865
Come on, man, this is a big win.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.558
Be happy.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.295
Ow.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.768
- Be happy!
- Stop it.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.870
Be happy.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:43.463
Ow! Will you just...

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.872
Be happy. Oh!
There's my little brother!

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.807
No, I'm not happy
suing my friend.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.344
I'm not happy suing anybody.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:50.913
Okay.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:53.881
Well, number one, Tom
Ellsworth is not your friend.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.952
And number two, I'm going to bed

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.880
'cause you're a buzzkill.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:05.485
<i>Paul tells us that...</i>

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.564
even if you can
speak the language

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:12.465
of both man and
angels, if you lack love,

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:13.695
brothers and sisters,

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.432
you're just making
a lot of noise.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:19.998
<i>Maybe you're the
world's smartest person</i>

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:24.303
<i>and you have a great faith
that can move mountains</i>

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.678
or you give all your
money to the poor

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.878
or you give your
body over to hardship.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:33.718
My Bible says, without love,

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:36.383
you say nothing.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:40.293
<i>Without love, you gain nothing.</i>

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.558
Without love,

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:45.499
<i>you are nothing.</i>

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.077
Hey, Adam.

01:12:04.387 --> 01:12:06.481
- Hey.
- Pastor Dave?

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:07.852
Is it true?

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.585
I don't... I don't know...

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:10.955
- Is it? Tell me.
- Adam!

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:15.690
- You killed Jude, didn't you?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.838
- Take it easy, pal.
- Get off of me! Get off of me!

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:20.903
What is wrong with you?

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.965
Hey, man, what's going on?

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:32.471
That is messed up.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.360
Sign with that pen.

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:46.656
What am I signing?

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.073
Just saying I just
took your fingerprints

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.395
and you're just being booked in.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.932
Is this, like, a mug shot?

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.661
Yes.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.930
<i>After a shocking confrontation</i>

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.132
<i>by Reverend David Hill on
Hadleigh campus, the suspect</i>

01:12:58.441 --> 01:13:00.501
has been identified
as 21-year-old

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.943
Hadleigh student
Adam Richertson.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.378
The college senior
has no criminal record

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.074
and no history of violence,

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.079
which has left many
people wondering

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.480
what inspired this
deadly attack on a church.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.784
I'm so sorry.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.996
<i>This is beyond messed up.</i>

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:26.399
I know Adam.

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:29.097
He's a good dude... sincerely.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:32.807
And Pastor Dave needs to
take a page from his own book.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.138
So, you know what?

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.071
We're having a
protest Friday night.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.510
Saint James.

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.514
Make sure your voice is heard.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.083
Be there. Be mad.

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:44.984
'Cause this fight
is far from over.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.049
Have you seen this?

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.756
Media works both ways.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:55.024
This gives us a real shot.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.759
Get the team working on it.

01:13:56.866 --> 01:14:00.200
I'm gonna send a gift
basket to Reverend Dave.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:05.671
<i>We condemn</i>

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:09.439
the hateful actions
of Adam Richertson

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:12.777
in the strongest possible terms.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:14.748
They do not represent the values

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.115
of our esteemed
Hadleigh University.

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:20.781
We will not stand for
violence or discrimination

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.758
in any form, of any people,

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:27.921
regardless of their religious
backgrounds and beliefs.

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.057
We've taken the immediate
steps to expel Mr. Richertson,

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.159
and we have encouraged the state

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:37.565
to prosecute him to the
fullest extent of the law.

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:40.142
None of this, however,

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:44.043
should excuse the actions
of Reverend Dave Hill.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:48.584
His outburst has made
our position stronger:

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.949
that Saint James
Church has become

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.989
a beacon of violence
and controversy,

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:57.720
and it has no place here

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.092
on Hadleigh University campus.

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:01.824
Good day.

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.531
So, Reverend Hill
goes after Ellsworth.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:10.901
Now Ellsworth fires back.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.737
And meanwhile, this
kid Adam Richertson

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:14.208
is caught in the crossfire.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.430
- Judge, this kid killed somebody.
- Oh, come on.

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:18.590
- It was an accident. Everybody knows that.
- Can't forget it.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.658
Look, a judge and
jury's gonna decide that.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.762
Speaking of judge and jury,

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.227
who's gonna hold this
reverend accountable?

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.962
Okay, there's a big
difference between a death,

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.682
okay, and-and a
fight, but this reverend

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.620
did attack this
kid, and now he's

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.715
calling for the kid to get
put away for 30 years?

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:31.203
- That's insane.
- Well, and there you have it.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:33.219
Both sides are totally fired up.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.760
Huge protest is
planned for the weekend.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.561
And this is teed
up for disaster.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:39.658
That's the sign of
the times, isn't it?

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:40.930
Everybody's yelling.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.596
- Nobody's listening.
- Absolutely.

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.017
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.566
<i>Nothing makes sense.</i>

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:50.644
Adam never meant to hurt anyone.

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:53.944
I'm not saying he shouldn't
own up to what he did, but...

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:56.178
I just don't see
God's mercy here.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.015
Especially not from Pastor Dave.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.816
He's human, Keaton.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.891
Yeah, but he's supposed
to be a man of God.

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:03.789
What kind of example is that?

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.156
I mean, if being a Christian

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.025
doesn't affect the
way we act, then...

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:11.226
how do we actually
know that our values

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.326
and beliefs are any more
valid than anyone else's?

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.066
Can I show you something?

01:16:24.146 --> 01:16:27.207
A friend sent this to me
when I was in high school.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.691
It was inspiring.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.953
It's why I came to Hadleigh.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.824
I wanted to be a
part of something.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.898
At the time, I'd never even

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:45.297
considered that
God could be dead.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.806
But now...

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:55.667
It's okay, Keaton.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.714
It's good to ask
difficult questions.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.112
God can use it.

01:17:00.216 --> 01:17:02.845
He's not afraid of
your uncertainty.

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:04.921
But I am.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:09.018
You know, I... I think
about John the Baptist.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.254
If anyone should've been
sure about Jesus, it was him.

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.762
And John said, "I've
seen, and I testify

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:17.231
that this is the Son of God."

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:21.794
And then he got locked
up in Herod's little jail cell,

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:23.348
and the doubts started
messing with his head.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:24.932
"What if I'm wrong
about this Jesus guy?

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.800
"What if all the stories
I've heard about him

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.811
healing people... what
if it's just ridiculous?"

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:30.243
So John sent some of his friends

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:33.282
to watch Jesus and report back.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:38.150
And Jesus told them, "Tell
John what you've seen and heard.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.951
"The blind receive their sight.

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.422
"The lame walk.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.250
"The lepers are cleansed.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.261
The deaf hear."

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:48.092
John needed to doubt.

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.961
Why, though?

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:54.264
Because... uncertainty
led to the pursuit of truth.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:18:00.038
I know it hurts...

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:02.168
to be in the fire.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.874
And as painful and...

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.678
confusing as all of this is,

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:12.721
it just might be exactly where
God wants you right now.

01:18:16.926 --> 01:18:18.155
Well, it ain't good.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.580
Public opinion,
your reputation...

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.162
It's all gonna take a hit.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:23.129
I guess we'll have
to wait and see.

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:25.827
The kid confessed,
so... that helps.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.927
I just... I want to know
what you were thinking.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.869
I wasn't thinking, obviously.

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:32.271
You get an anonymous text,
then you go nuts on somebody?

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:35.469
I'm not interested in
rehashing this, okay?

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.107
Sorry, folks.

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:52.952
What's going on with you?

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.031
I'm a mess. I don't
know what I'm doing,

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.723
I don't know what
God wants me to do,

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:58.743
and I don't know why any
of this is even happening.

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:00.445
- First, you gotta settle down.
- Oh, I'm sure...

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.480
I'm sure this is fun for you.
You get a front-row seat

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.064
to watch your little brother,
Dave, just self-destruct.

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:07.803
That's probably why you drove
down here in the first place.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.474
Where are you going?

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.217
Oh, I'm walking.

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:17.479
You can't.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.914
- Watch me.
- Pearce.

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:22.757
What?

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.190
You have the car keys.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:06.927
Dave.

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.868
Hey, Roland.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.240
How you doing?

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:13.969
Doing all right.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:18.980
You're sure on TV a lot
for someone doing all right.

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:20.879
All this business
with Tom Ellsworth.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.884
And now the boy.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:24.510
Well, I didn't
ask for this fight.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.813
Mm, that's a
fact, but here it is.

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.552
Keep your eye on
what's important.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:33.419
I think what's important
is that Christians stop

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:35.589
rolling over all the time.

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:37.833
When is it our right to fight?

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.561
I'm tired of being
pushed around.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:41.336
I'm tired of turning
the other cheek.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.429
Oh, so now you're tired.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:46.168
A minute ago, you
were doing all right.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:47.937
I'm just saying,
I think it's time

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.909
that Christians stand
up for themselves.

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:55.476
Well...

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:59.146
people were drawn to
Jesus because of His...

01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:01.155
His love.

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:03.885
His patience and kindness.

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:06.928
He managed to preach the truth

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.863
without losing
Himself in the bargain.

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.866
He was gentle with the meek

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:15.199
and hard as a rock
with the arrogant.

01:21:15.304 --> 01:21:19.901
And when He talked to
the foolish, He was patient

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:23.536
and never became a fool Himself.

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:26.877
And He was never proud, David.

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:30.885
This has nothing to
do with pride, Roland.

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.388
And no offense, but maybe
you'd understand a little better

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.459
if you were the
one being attacked.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:39.323
Brother, who do you
think you're talking to?

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:41.329
I'm a black preacher
in the Deep South.

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.456
I could build you a
church with all the bricks

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.659
been thrown through my windows.

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:50.066
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.608
You gotta work through the pain.

01:21:57.312 --> 01:22:01.147
We cannot respond
to hate with more hate.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.652
And don't forget.

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:09.185
We are called to be a light

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.658
in the darkness.

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.033
I miss Jude.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.710
And I miss You, too, Lord.

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:37.612
I'm trying to do the
right thing. I just...

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:43.421
I don't know what
that is anymore.

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.427
Hey there.

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.660
Just checking on you.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.365
I saw the news.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:58.566
I can't imagine
what you're feeling.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:00.973
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.545
<i>How about a little adventure?</i>

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.308
<i>Um, I'm gonna
send you a drop pin.</i>

01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:08.680
<i>I'll meet you there in an hour?</i>

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.315
It's my church away from church.

01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:16.051
It's where I come
to be alone with God.

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.528
- I can see why.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.733
What do you got there?

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:28.735
I light a candle for
people I'm praying for.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.496
Uh...

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.439
folks I meet at the restaurant,

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:35.602
friends from A.A.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.771
You.

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:46.145
I just love the way He uses
other people in our lives to...

01:23:46.255 --> 01:23:48.087
to bring us comfort.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:52.525
To remind us that we're loved.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.757
I think you need to
be reminded right now.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:03.038
God is here.

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.573
I'm here.

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.275
And you're loved.

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.630
I thought you were out with Meg.

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:31.632
You screw that up, too?

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.565
What are you doing?

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:36.161
Listen, I'm gonna fly
back to Chicago tonight.

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:38.103
I left you the name
and, uh, number

01:24:38.206 --> 01:24:39.606
of an attorney friend of mine.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:42.337
She'll take good
care of you. My treat.

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:44.538
Why? Just because
we had an argument?

01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:47.206
- It's just time.
- Pearce, are you kidding me?

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:51.377
You know what?

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.114
Go ahead.

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:55.747
Oh, I haven't done
enough for you, huh?

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.621
Come down here,
put my life on hold,

01:24:57.726 --> 01:24:59.558
but I'm the bad guy
now 'cause I'm bailing?

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.254
Is that it?

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:03.161
Let's not get into
it. It's not worth it.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.257
No, I-I think it's worth
it. Let's get into it.

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:07.359
It's water under the bridge.

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.233
I forgave you years ago.

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:10.601
You forgave me?

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:12.698
For what exactly? For leaving?

01:25:12.808 --> 01:25:14.140
You forced me out.

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.437
You and Mom and Dad. All you.

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:17.274
Give me a break. No
one forced you out.

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:18.472
Oh, yes, you did.

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.780
I wasn't welcome in this house

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:21.361
once I started asking
tough questions.

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:23.442
Is that what they
were? Tough questions?

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:25.487
Oh, "Why does
God allow bad things

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:26.816
to happen to good people?"

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:28.562
Or, "How do we even
know God exists?"

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.101
- Really?
- You should back off, little brother.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.593
Maybe you were
just trying to impress

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:34.162
a coed with how worldly
and forward-thinking you were.

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.560
I guess your Christian roots

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:37.141
- were too provincial.
- Well, at least

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.293
I know what's happening
in the world five miles

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.802
- outside the county line.
- You're right, I don't know.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.270
And I don't know why
you left me to take care

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:46.308
of Mom and Dad
when they were sick.

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:47.685
Why did you leave
me to take care

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.803
of everything after
they were gone?

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:52.676
Do you have any idea what
you did to Mom and Dad?

01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:54.147
You broke their hearts.

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.480
You're the one
that broke my heart!

01:25:56.585 --> 01:25:58.611
You really don't
get that, do you?

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.348
You didn't take the time

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.390
to understand what
I was going through.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:05.552
I was trying to sort
out my own faith.

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.392
My own sense of God.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.796
I was changing, and
you all hated me for it,

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.494
and that's the truth, David.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.568
What am I doing wrong?

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.776
Just show me.

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:07.882
Please.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:03.930
<i>As the battle rages
on in Hope Springs,</i>

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:06.941
<i>police say they're expecting
hundreds of students and locals</i>

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:09.807
<i>for a protest outside Saint
James Church tonight...</i>

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:12.745
<i>Some showing support for
the church, others continuing</i>

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.783
<i>to call for its removal.</i>

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.555
Keaton.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:25.718
Did you ever even stop to
ask why Adam threw that brick?

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:28.126
He's tired of feeling
judged and rejected

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:31.764
by the people who should
be loving and accepting.

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.110
You want to know
why our generation's

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:34.568
leaving the church?

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:36.001
It's because the
whole world knows

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.824
what the church is
against, but it's getting

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.739
harder and harder
to know what it's for.

01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:43.979
You're right.

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.075
There's something I need to do.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:50.545
Will you come with me?

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.114
KEATON; <i>Pastor
Dave is here to see you.</i>

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:56.891
<i>If you want.</i>

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.587
Sure.

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:02.425
Okay.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:27.045
I'm the one that sent
you that message.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.860
I needed you to know.

01:30:36.865 --> 01:30:39.926
I guess I was
hoping that you'd...

01:30:40.035 --> 01:30:41.867
Forgive.

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:52.908
This is, uh... this
is Jude's Bible.

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:01.456
He'd want you to have it.

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:13.525
I'm so sorry.

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.762
About Jude, I am so...

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:20.000
sorry.

01:31:37.025 --> 01:31:40.860
We want to plead
for leniency for Adam.

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:42.828
I'm the only witness
the state has.

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:44.797
I'll tell the D.A. what I saw...

01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:47.528
That Jude's death couldn't
have been premeditated.

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.729
I spoke with Jude's parents.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.932
They feel the same.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.872
We're hoping the state

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:55.807
will agree to a lesser charge.

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.277
Drop it from a felony
to a misdemeanor.

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.776
Hopefully he doesn't have
to do any more jail time.

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.680
Why?

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:05.618
The boy shouldn't be collateral
damage for our fight, Tom.

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:12.785
There's gonna be a big
protest tonight at the church.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:15.762
Town's on edge. The
whole thing has gone too far.

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:18.299
- Didn't have to.
- You're right.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.193
And I'm sorry.

01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:24.137
I truly am.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.602
For everything.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:38.748
Me, too.

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.151
My part.

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:50.958
So, what about the church?

01:32:57.839 --> 01:32:58.932
The church must go!

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.338
Enough is enough!

01:33:00.642 --> 01:33:01.701
The church must go!

01:33:19.828 --> 01:33:22.024
Can I talk to them?
This is my church.

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:36.707
One God! One truth! One God!

01:33:36.811 --> 01:33:38.006
One truth!

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:44.979
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.611
The church must go!

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:49.748
Enough is enough!
The church must go!

01:33:49.858 --> 01:33:51.690
Can I have your attention?

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:53.237
The church must go!

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:56.163
Can I please say something?

01:33:56.264 --> 01:33:58.130
Get out of here!

01:33:58.233 --> 01:34:00.964
Excuse me. May
I... may I just say...

01:34:01.069 --> 01:34:02.697
may I say something?

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.209
May I please say something?

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:12.905
Please. Please.

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:15.074
Let's hear what
the man has to say.

01:34:16.851 --> 01:34:18.183
Thank you.

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:23.083
I came here tonight

01:34:23.191 --> 01:34:27.253
to ask all of you
for your forgiveness.

01:34:30.932 --> 01:34:34.096
The other night, I stood
before this burnt altar,

01:34:34.202 --> 01:34:38.936
and I heard God's voice for
the first time in a long time.

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:42.743
Couldn't have been clearer.

01:34:44.746 --> 01:34:47.682
He said, "This building...

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:50.047
is not My church."

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:54.714
Although Saint James
has meant everything to me,

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.688
although it's been
my whole life...

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:02.226
I would gladly give
all of that up for this.

01:35:04.332 --> 01:35:05.800
For you.

01:35:09.237 --> 01:35:13.174
So I am withdrawing my
lawsuit against the school

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:16.039
and dropping the charges
against Adam Richertson.

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:18.045
I've also agreed to
turn this land over

01:35:18.146 --> 01:35:19.842
to Hadleigh University

01:35:19.948 --> 01:35:23.214
so that they can use it to
build a new student center,

01:35:23.318 --> 01:35:25.719
a long overdue
addition to this campus.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.448
Chancellor Ellsworth
has assured me

01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:29.348
that this new facility
will have a space

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:30.925
for our Harbor House,

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:35.463
led by our campus
minister, Josh Wheaton.

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:38.961
As for me...

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:40.968
I'm going to build a new church.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:45.063
And I don't know how,
I don't know where yet,

01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:47.870
but I'm willing to bet that
God can handle the details,

01:35:47.976 --> 01:35:50.810
and I'd love your help.

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:52.210
All of you.

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:56.080
We can build
something new together.

01:35:56.184 --> 01:35:59.177
But for now, please...

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:01.119
put down those signs.

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:04.158
Put 'em down.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.456
Please.

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.329
Go ahead, lay them down.

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:14.163
Put 'em down.

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:17.000
Everyone.

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:25.312
Let's stop shouting
at each other

01:36:25.413 --> 01:36:27.905
and start listening.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:32.152
It's the only way that
things will get better.

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:36.088
Now, please, take these candles.

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:39.058
And let's stand together.

01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:26.031
Thank you.

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.919
Let this candle represent...

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.490
peace, hope...

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.149
and unity.

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:52.532
And love.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:06.276
<i>Sometimes all it
takes is a spark.</i>

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:10.952
<i>Something very small.</i>

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:13.647
<i>But the spark becomes a flame.</i>

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.217
<i>And if that flame spreads,</i>

01:38:17.325 --> 01:38:19.453
<i>the power can be so overwhelming</i>

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.291
<i>it transforms
everything around it.</i>

01:38:33.608 --> 01:38:35.099
<i>The divisive pastor</i>

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.974
<i>at the center of weeks
of vehement protests</i>

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:39.945
<i>has suddenly become
a symbol of forgiveness</i>

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:42.607
and unity in Hope Springs.

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:45.284
And what was once a city divided

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:48.652
is now a community
coming together to heal.

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:51.152
I... You can't be taken
seriously as a leader

01:38:51.259 --> 01:38:53.285
if you roll over
for your enemies.

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:55.272
Now, I don't think that
Reverend Hill rolled over.

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:56.640
I think that he saw
people suffering

01:38:56.664 --> 01:38:58.132
and he made a
sacrifice for them.

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.133
Surely, the parallels
to Christianity

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:02.703
are not lost on you.

01:39:03.004 --> 01:39:05.405
So, I mean, call it a
publicity stunt if you want,

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:06.667
but we were there.

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:08.465
I mean, this dude's legit.

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:10.135
He would have won.

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.804
He could have given
Hadleigh the finger,

01:39:12.013 --> 01:39:13.413
but he handed it back.

01:39:13.514 --> 01:39:15.225
He cares more about this
community than winning.

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.308
I believe that.

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.045
Perhaps the rest of the country

01:39:18.152 --> 01:39:20.178
can take a page from this book.

01:39:20.288 --> 01:39:22.018
Your 2:00 is here.

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:23.614
Send her in, Charlotte.

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:26.325
Hey. Let me guess.

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.658
You're probably on
another phone interview.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:31.008
Listen, if you're going to
do the media circuit thing,

01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:33.160
why don't you get
a big-boy haircut,

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.668
get Meg to take you
clothes shopping.

01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:38.997
Um, give me a call when
you get your head above water.

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:42.406
I want to hear about the
plans for the new digs.

01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.608
I'm proud of
you, little brother.

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:50.641
Take care, David.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.694
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.517
Congratulations.

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:29.399
- I think you're going to love it here.
- Thank you.

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.652
Thank you.

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.425
You know what I was thinking?

01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:38.159
What's that?

01:40:38.266 --> 01:40:40.758
Jude was right.

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:42.696
God is good.

01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:45.629
All the time.

01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:48.669
And all the time...

01:40:50.111 --> 01:40:52.171
God is good.

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.246
<i>I can hear You again.</i>

01:40:58.352 --> 01:41:03.256
<i>And even though I know
You were never really gone...</i>

01:41:05.293 --> 01:41:07.728

The healing that happened
here can happen anywhere.

01:44:58.559 --> 01:45:00.653
I'm Michael Tait
of the Newsboys.

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:02.889
The cure to what
plagues our world

01:45:02.997 --> 01:45:05.466
isn't more division
or finger pointing.

01:45:05.566 --> 01:45:07.535
It's hope and unity.

01:45:07.635 --> 01:45:10.036
And letting Christ's
love shine through us.

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:12.431
The beauty of the human race

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:15.840
is found in the diversity
of the human race.

01:45:15.943 --> 01:45:17.605
Let's celebrate this.

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:19.942
Since the very first
<i>God's Not Dead</i> movie,

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:22.312
we set out to inspire a movement

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:26.478
to show God is alive
and still working today.

01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:29.716
It's not easy to see in a world
of division and anger and pain,

01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:33.090
but God remains
good all the time.

01:45:33.394 --> 01:45:35.761
We just need to show
it through our words,

01:45:35.863 --> 01:45:38.389
our actions and our love.

01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:41.731
It's our chance to
be a light in darkness.

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:43.532
So let's start right now.

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:47.039
As you leave the theaters,
share a message of integrity

01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:51.073
and unity with your family
and friends on social media

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.904
with the hashtag #GodsNotDead

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:56.449
and by downloading
the God's Not Dead app.

01:45:56.550 --> 01:46:00.920
Together, we can create a wave
of hope and inspiration online.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:04.480
Our world desperately
needs to see the light.

01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:05.787
Let's share it.

01:46:05.893 --> 01:46:06.986
Let's be it.

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.528
God bless you.
