WEBVTT

00:00:01.194 --> 00:00:06.096
[grand orchestral
fanfare playing]

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:06.017
{\an8}A shocking turn of events
six weeks prior to Election Day,

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.813
{\an8}Congressional incumbent
Rick West has died

00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:10.298
{\an8}of an apparent heart attack.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.610
{\an8}His opponent, State
Senator Peter Kane,

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:14.302
{\an8}now runs unopposed,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.994
{\an8}canceling tonight’s
highly anticipated debate.

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:19.445
He gave this
statement earlier today.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.240
[reporters clamoring]

00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:23.173
Senator Kane.

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:24.898
Sir, with West’s sudden
passing, you’ve gone overnight

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:27.073
from dark horse to sure
thing. What is your response?

00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.869
Well, first and foremost, I
want to express my condolences

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:31.664
to the West family.

00:01:31.802 --> 00:01:34.736
Although the congressman
and I agreed on very little,

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:36.876
I still considered him
a worthy opponent.

00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:39.499
What about criticisms
of your plans to pass laws

00:01:39.637 --> 00:01:41.950
to restrict religious freedoms
and support bigger government?

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:43.952
That’s enough questions for
now. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.609
- We need answers.
- He’s got to go.

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:48.025
- [reporters clamoring]
- Senator, we need answers.

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.234
- Sir, sir! Senator Kane!
- Come back, Senator!

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:51.856
WESLEY: Thank you guys.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

00:01:52.823 --> 00:01:54.514
[Kane sighs]

00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:56.378
KANE: So this would’ve
been our battleground, huh?

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.242
Oh, I wish I could’ve
debated West.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.796
I could’ve struck the death
blow myself. [chuckles]

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.315
Senator.

00:02:02.453 --> 00:02:04.145
KANE: Dan Thompson,
big fan of the show.

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:06.008
[chuckles]

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:09.909
Gentlemen, the
passing of Rick West

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.291
may allow us to
catch up with the rest

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.741
- of the modern world.
- [others murmuring]

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.675
I have always said that
religious superstition

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:21.852
has no place in influencing
our laws and government.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.856
So, here’s to
enlightenment, reason

00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:28.652
and reshaping our nation’s core.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.654
OTHERS: Cheers.

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:36.763
{\an8}DAVID: You see those statues
and those monuments out there?

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.903
{\an8}They’re trying to
tell us something.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.216
{\an8}They’re saying,
"Don’t forget about us.

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:43.736
{\an8}"Don’t forget about the...
the battles that we fought

00:02:43.874 --> 00:02:46.601
{\an8}"and the price that
we paid for freedom.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.190
{\an8}Don’t let our
sacrifice be in vain."

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.606
In the long history
of the world,

00:02:51.744 --> 00:02:56.404
only a few generations
have been granted the role

00:02:56.542 --> 00:03:01.132
of defending freedom in
its hour of maximum danger.

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.927
Ask not

00:03:03.065 --> 00:03:05.344
what America will do for you

00:03:05.482 --> 00:03:09.244
but what together we can
do for the freedom of man.

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:11.591
DAVID: That’s part
of your plan, isn’t it?

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.732
Keep us all divided so
bit by bit, we don’t realize

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.356
you’re chipping away at
our freedoms and liberties.

00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:19.427
Because it’s all
about power for you.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.981
And the only way that
you can get more power

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.983
is by taking it
from someone else.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.640
And that would be
all well and good

00:03:25.778 --> 00:03:27.469
if it wasn’t for
that pesky thing

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.471
called the Constitution that
keeps getting in your way.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.611
- [applause]
- RONALD REAGAN: Without God,

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:33.751
we are mired in the material,

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.306
that flat world that tells us
only what the senses perceive.

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:39.447
{\an8}Without God, there
is a coarsening

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:42.208
{\an8}- of the society.
- [crowd clamoring]

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.831
{\an8}And without God,
democracy will not

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.799
{\an8}and cannot long endure.

00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:48.801
[applause]

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.079
If we ever forget that
we’re one nation under God,

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:54.496
then we will be a
nation gone under.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.809
DAVID: They know
what’s at stake here.

00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:58.914
And maybe in order to understand

00:03:59.052 --> 00:04:01.745
how precious and
fragile freedom really is,

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:03.264
maybe...

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:07.060
maybe you have to lose it.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:18.624
[siren blaring]

00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:23.767
[busy chatter]

00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:27.529
KANE [over TV]:
...and so has America.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.220
Okay, if you can give
me those numbers,

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:31.119
I’d appreciate it.

00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:33.501
KANE [over TV]: We must
not let religious superstitions

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.470
determine our laws of
culture, science and reason.

00:04:37.608 --> 00:04:39.817
[busy chatter continues]

00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:43.718
- Yes, sir.
- We should be fine with all of that.

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:46.030
I’m hoping that
the electoral ballots

00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:47.342
that we have on the
other side will be great.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.930
This is a disaster.

00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:51.139
Why didn’t we have
a contingency plan?

00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:55.039
DAVID [over monitor]: They’re
trying to tell us something.

00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:59.389
They’re saying,
"Don’t forget about us.

00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:02.461
"Don’t forget about the...
the battles that we fought

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.256
and the price that
we paid for freedom."

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:06.534
Wasn’t there an attorney in line

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.190
- to replace West?
- Collins?

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:10.331
- Collins.
- Dropped out three days ago.

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:11.849
[sighs]

00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:13.334
MURRAY: No one
thought West could lose.

00:05:13.472 --> 00:05:15.025
Any help here, boss?

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:16.544
DAVID [over monitor]:
...bit by bit, you’re

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.097
chipping away at our
freedoms and liberty.

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:19.788
Meanwhile, you’re
crafting legislation

00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:22.550
that will allow the government
to barge into our homes.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.552
STAFF MEMBER: We’re
fried. Got no time to recruit.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.036
No time to vet.

00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:29.039
If the House flips,
hello, socialism.

00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.317
DAVID [over monitor]: ...by
taking it from someone else.

00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:32.801
And that would be
all well and good

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.872
if it wasn’t for
that pesky thing

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.495
called the Constitution that
keeps getting in your way.

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:37.772
CHAIRMAN [over monitor]:
Now, you hold on a second.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.808
No, I’m done talking to you.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.672
I’m talking to the
people who elected you.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.778
MURRAY: I remember him.

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:45.366
The preacher.

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:47.471
He helped out on those
education hearings.

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:49.059
Helped out?

00:05:49.197 --> 00:05:50.785
I’d say he knocked
them out the park.

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:53.339
You see those statues and
those monuments out there?

00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:56.860
They say you work for us.

00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:58.758
- [applause over monitor]
- This guy is gold.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.589
- Mm-hmm.
- The reverend vibe really works.

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:04.799
{\an8}"...by the people,
for the people."

00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:06.041
{\an8}STAFF MEMBER 2: Who’s
gonna run his campaign?

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.767
Leave that to me.

00:06:07.905 --> 00:06:09.493
DAVID [over monitor]:
America belongs to its citizens.

00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:12.116
SMITH: Look, we’re six
weeks out from Election Day.

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:17.156
And remember, this is a
fight for the soul of our nation.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:19.400
DAVID [over monitor]: ...and
the teachers in Oklahoma,

00:06:19.538 --> 00:06:22.575
to every man, woman and child.

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:25.267
It belongs to the people.

00:06:25.406 --> 00:06:27.200
We the people.

00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:30.100
It belongs to the
people, Mr. Chairman.

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:32.309
We the people.

00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.834
I am so sorry.

00:06:39.972 --> 00:06:42.112
MONICA: We have no place to go.

00:06:43.147 --> 00:06:45.667
[sniffles] How
could this happen?

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.773
The women’s center was
supposed to receive funding

00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:50.914
for the repairs from
the government, and...

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.538
...it just didn’t happen.

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:56.816
- [baby fussing]
- [sighs]

00:06:56.954 --> 00:06:58.404
[sniffles]

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:01.372
We can’t go to
the city shelters.

00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:03.202
They’re not safe.

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:06.999
There’s a sign at the
women’s center that says,

00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:11.417
"Provided by God,
through His people."

00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:13.488
Who dropped the ball, Pastor?

00:07:13.626 --> 00:07:15.248
I mean, I know it wasn’t God.

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:17.181
Please believe me, Monica.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.011
I did my best.

00:07:22.152 --> 00:07:24.568
I just wish my best was better.

00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:26.777
I’m sorry.

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:31.955
Monica, wait. Give
me some time, and I’ll...

00:07:35.648 --> 00:07:37.512
[sighs]

00:07:39.134 --> 00:07:41.827
[bell tolling]

00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:56.738
[sighs]

00:08:00.052 --> 00:08:02.503
How’s it going, Pastor?

00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:04.263
Uh...

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:10.338
How many more families are
left for me to break the news to?

00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:14.273
Thirty-two.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.207
I can talk to some of them
on your behalf if that will help.

00:08:18.242 --> 00:08:20.797
Thanks, Martin,
but it should be me.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.560
None of this needed to happen.

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:31.083
The government pulled
the grant money because--

00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:33.016
are you ready for this?--

00:08:33.154 --> 00:08:36.467
some women at the
center had a Bible study.

00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:41.542
They canceled the
grant because of that?

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.578
They claim the center
used grant money

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:47.306
{\an8}for religious instruction,
and that’s not allowed.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:52.380
{\an8}So the women and their
families are penalized.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.972
[sighs]

00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:05.427
It’s like God keeps putting

00:09:05.566 --> 00:09:07.947
these impossible
mountains in front of me.

00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:11.744
And the government doesn’t
make it any easier on us.

00:09:13.297 --> 00:09:16.128
That probably makes
me sound paranoid, but...

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:22.686
About 50 years ago,

00:09:22.824 --> 00:09:26.069
the Chinese government,
under the guise of progress,

00:09:26.207 --> 00:09:30.521
blamed all the country’s
problems on religion and faith.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.801
They called it the
Cultural Revolution,

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:37.598
but that is just to
cover up the truth.

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:40.428
What was the truth?

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:45.744
Churches were destroyed.

00:09:45.882 --> 00:09:49.782
Christians were persecuted
and put into camps.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.922
Countless were killed.

00:09:55.339 --> 00:09:57.445
A similar revolution
seems to be brewing

00:09:57.583 --> 00:09:59.309
here in America, David.

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:04.935
It may look different, but
the essence is the same.

00:10:05.073 --> 00:10:08.767
So, no, I don’t think
you’re being paranoid.

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:14.013
And perhaps God put those
mountains in front of you

00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:16.671
to show that they can be moved.

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:23.471
[sighs]

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:30.167
SMITH: So, you’re not gonna
ask me anything about my guy?

00:10:30.305 --> 00:10:31.928
[scoffs] A pastor?

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.964
Smith, really?

00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:36.587
You think that’s what this race
needs right now-- a sermon?

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:38.900
[chuckles] Well, what
this race needs is integrity.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:41.592
- Mm.
- Someone unspoiled.

00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:44.216
Hill represents what
we’ve lost in politics.

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:48.047
And yes, he is a man of faith
and he is a man of the people.

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:49.946
You think he can go
toe to toe with Kane?

00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:51.533
- Oh.
- The man’s a shark.

00:10:51.672 --> 00:10:53.156
That’s where you come in.

00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.402
[sighs] So, what’s the ask?

00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:02.717
You know what’s at stake.

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:04.926
The margins in the
House are razor-thin.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.721
LOTTIE: Mm.

00:11:11.312 --> 00:11:13.245
Why me?

00:11:13.383 --> 00:11:15.385
Because there’s no one better.

00:11:16.248 --> 00:11:19.907
No one had ever heard
of me until you came along.

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:22.599
I mean, you put me
on the map, Lottie,

00:11:22.737 --> 00:11:25.706
and I’m just hoping you
could do the same for David.

00:11:27.846 --> 00:11:29.054
[sighs]

00:11:29.192 --> 00:11:31.953
I left this game
for a reason, Daryl.

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.265
- Left?
- Yeah.

00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:34.749
Or ran away?

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.718
I have a son now.
Things are different.

00:11:37.856 --> 00:11:40.375
Yeah, very different.

00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:42.964
Actually, a lot worse.

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.415
You said you left this behind.

00:11:45.553 --> 00:11:48.418
I know you see the
writing on the wall.

00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:51.732
They will have complete control.

00:11:53.181 --> 00:11:55.287
And hiding in the mountains

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.254
is not gonna protect
you from what’s coming.

00:11:57.392 --> 00:12:00.119
You or your son.

00:12:01.845 --> 00:12:03.157
I’ll have to think about it.

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:04.814
You don’t even have
time to pack, Lottie.

00:12:04.952 --> 00:12:06.608
That is what I’ve
been trying to tell you.

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:09.232
We might already be too late.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:13.443
We need you there tomorrow.

00:12:17.619 --> 00:12:21.071
Is there anything else I
need to know, Congressman?

00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:38.779
They sent John Wesley
to run Kane’s campaign.

00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:43.542
- I know what John did to you.
- [gasps]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.578
[shuddering exhale]

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:48.443
I’m not asking you
to fight your past.

00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:54.001
I am asking that you help

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.245
shape our country’s future.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.811
[insects trilling]

00:13:12.847 --> 00:13:14.538
LOTTIE: "And then
the king was very sad

00:13:14.676 --> 00:13:16.402
"because when he
touched his daughter,

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.404
she turned to gold."

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.786
CHRISTOPHER: Couldn’t he
just sell her for a bajillion dollars

00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:22.477
- and buy another daughter?
- [laughs]

00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:25.549
It doesn’t work that
way, goose. Silly.

00:13:25.687 --> 00:13:28.621
You want to sell me
for a bajillion dollars?

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:30.692
A bajillion dollars.

00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:35.801
Mm, not even a bajillion
quadrillion dollars.

00:13:38.597 --> 00:13:40.702
Are you sure you’re gonna
be okay with me leaving

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.428
for a little while?

00:13:42.566 --> 00:13:45.155
I promise you and Aunt
Ruby will have lots of fun.

00:13:45.293 --> 00:13:48.193
Will I get to go
to Disney World?

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:51.230
Oh, bargaining. I like that.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.130
I’m sure that can be arranged.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.546
Yes, of course. Mm-hmm.

00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:00.826

00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:02.932

All right, here we go.

00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:40.417
Rev, what’s the matter?

00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:42.247
- Ah... I know, I know.
- You’re off your game.

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:44.766
I’m just... I just wish
there was a better turnout

00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:46.907
for the women’s shelter is all.

00:14:47.045 --> 00:14:49.530
Oh, well, come on.
Give it another try.

00:14:49.668 --> 00:14:52.395
- Ah.
- You can’t win unless you play.

00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:54.293
- Sure. Why not?
- [chuckles]

00:14:55.363 --> 00:14:57.952
LOTTIE: Oh, you know
it’s rigged, don’t you?

00:14:59.057 --> 00:15:01.059
Oh, yeah? Why do you say that?

00:15:01.197 --> 00:15:05.132
Well, I mean, the rings
are too small, and...

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.066
can’t win unless you
find the right angle.

00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:09.205
Hmm.

00:15:11.793 --> 00:15:13.623
Lottie Jay.

00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:15.314
- Political consultant.
- Mm.

00:15:15.452 --> 00:15:17.661
David Hill. Fresh
out of business cards.

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:20.285
[laughs] I know who
you are, Reverend.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.152
LOTTIE: I believe in
cutting to the chase.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.292
I’ve been hired to manage
your campaign for Congress.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.226
I’m sorry, did you say my
campaign for Congress?

00:15:30.364 --> 00:15:33.022
Our friend Daryl Smith
thinks you’re our best bet

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.609
at beating Kane.

00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:36.991
Peter Kane, the state senator?

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:38.303
Yep.

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:41.202
Kane hides behind the separation

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.067
of church and state to
chase God from politics,

00:15:44.205 --> 00:15:46.794
from the classroom,
public square,

00:15:46.932 --> 00:15:48.658
from policymaking.

00:15:48.796 --> 00:15:51.523
If he wins, any institution
with a religious affiliation

00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:53.421
would be exempt
from public funding.

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:57.287
And I do mean
any daycare center,

00:15:57.425 --> 00:15:59.048
nursing home...

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.223
...women’s shelter.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:03.707
Yeah, but why?

00:16:03.845 --> 00:16:05.123
I mean, those institutions
serve the public

00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:06.262
regardless of their religion.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.195
I hear you, which is why...

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.679
- Barbecue platter for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

00:16:09.817 --> 00:16:11.646
And for you, the usual.

00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:14.235
- Possum pie.
- [chuckles]: Thanks, Tanya.

00:16:15.236 --> 00:16:18.826
Which is why the party
wants you to run against him.

00:16:18.964 --> 00:16:20.931
- What?
- There’s possum in that pie?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.072
Uh, no, it’s just chocolate
pudding hiding under...

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.350
Wait. I-I’m not a politician.

00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:28.077
You think the country really
needs another politician?

00:16:29.147 --> 00:16:31.494
Maybe it’s time you
try something new.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.744
[playful chatter]

00:16:40.882 --> 00:16:43.644
[laughter]

00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.716
[sighs] Well, this
isn’t nearly enough,

00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:48.683
but, you know, we did our best.

00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:49.891
Thanks so much, Kev.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.480
- Sure thing, Rev.
- Thank you.

00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:56.898
You know, as a congressman,
you’ll be able to add zeros

00:16:57.037 --> 00:16:59.039
to your charity drives.

00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:00.902
I don’t know anything
about politics.

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:03.491
It’s public service, same
as you’re doing now,

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:05.769
except there’s nothing
you can do as a pastor

00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:07.909
that can’t be undone
by a politician.

00:17:08.048 --> 00:17:09.773
If you want to make
a real difference,

00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:11.603
this is how it’s done.

00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:14.847
I’m a small-town pastor
with no national stage,

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:17.126
and I’m comfortable
with what we’ve built here.

00:17:17.264 --> 00:17:19.714
And I’m sorry you
came all this way, but I...

00:17:19.852 --> 00:17:21.682
I’m afraid I can’t help you.

00:17:22.993 --> 00:17:24.133
Hmm.

00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:26.307
Well, if you change your mind,

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:28.965
I’ll be flying back
first thing tomorrow.

00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:31.830
Give it some thought, Reverend.

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.972
You can call me David.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.629
We’ll see.

00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:43.290
[sighs]

00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:45.085
REPORTER: The search for
West’s replacement has begun,

00:17:45.223 --> 00:17:46.879
but at such a late date,

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:50.159
it’s uncertain who’d
be qualified and willing

00:17:50.297 --> 00:17:52.022
to risk their reputation

00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:54.680
for such a critical seat in
the House. We’ll continue...

00:17:54.818 --> 00:17:57.476
We may just get
another shot at this thing.

00:17:58.477 --> 00:17:59.858
What do they say?

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:03.068
When one door closes,
another one opens.

00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:04.932
[chuckles]

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.038
REPORTER: A spokesperson for
the West family has asked the public

00:18:08.177 --> 00:18:12.422
to respect the family’s privacy
during these most trying times.

00:18:16.219 --> 00:18:18.463
So I’m either
checking out tomorrow

00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:20.465
or, um, staying
for a couple weeks,

00:18:20.603 --> 00:18:22.087
but I’ll let you
know when I know.

00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:23.606
All right, that’s fine.

00:18:23.744 --> 00:18:25.159
- Thank you.
- Carlotta Jay.

00:18:25.297 --> 00:18:27.403
What a coincidence.

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.094
John. Hello.

00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:30.578
What the heck are you
doing in this Podunk town?

00:18:30.716 --> 00:18:32.408
They drag you out of
hiding for this circus?

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:35.549
I’m-I’m not in hiding, John. No.

00:18:35.687 --> 00:18:37.137
You gain weight?

00:18:37.275 --> 00:18:39.208
- Did I what?
- Put on a couple of pounds?

00:18:39.346 --> 00:18:42.142
No, I... I... I don’t
know, maybe.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.867
It comes with age.

00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:45.490
It is tougher on women.

00:18:45.628 --> 00:18:46.663
[scoffs] Wow.

00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.113
Unless it’s the-the meds.

00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:49.252
- Are you still taking...
- No, I’m not.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.460
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:51.910
No, I don’t need them, so...

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.222
Take your wins where
you can get them.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.706
- That’s what I believe.
- [sighs]

00:18:54.844 --> 00:18:56.294
Okay. Well, it’s
good seeing you.

00:18:56.432 --> 00:18:57.709
Thank... Where are you going?

00:18:57.847 --> 00:18:58.882
Why are you running off?

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.229
Come on, sit for a few minutes.

00:19:00.367 --> 00:19:02.369
A few minutes. It’s me.

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:05.820
- [sighs]
- Thank you.

00:19:06.787 --> 00:19:10.653
So... [sighs] who’s your horse?

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.172
I don’t have a horse.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.347
I’m, uh, just
vetting, helping out.

00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:16.693
- Me, too.
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:18.730
- My guy’s a slam dunk.
- [laughs]

00:19:18.868 --> 00:19:21.905
In fact, when it’s over,

00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:23.597
I am heading to
the South of France.

00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:25.288
Would you like to join moi?

00:19:26.358 --> 00:19:27.946
- Huh?
- Yeah.

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:29.879
- Wow. I am...
- S’il vous plaît.

00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:31.708
Think I’ll pass.

00:19:33.365 --> 00:19:34.780
Oh, it’s okay.

00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:36.851
- The weight looks good on you.
- [scoffs]

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:38.853
Charming, John.

00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:42.581
DAVID: So this thing is real?

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:43.755
SMITH: Very.

00:19:43.893 --> 00:19:45.170
And why not?

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:46.654
DAVID [over phone]:
Yeah, but why me?

00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:47.931
I mean, what about the
more qualified people

00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:49.623
already standing in the

00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:51.452
"I can’t wait to be a
congressperson" line?

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.385
Because at this late date, the
chances of winning are slim.

00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:55.870
No one is gonna
risk their reputation

00:19:56.008 --> 00:19:58.114
or their checkbook
on a long shot.

00:19:58.252 --> 00:20:01.290
So hit up a small-town
pastor with nothing to lose?

00:20:01.428 --> 00:20:03.740
Yeah. Maybe.

00:20:05.742 --> 00:20:07.503
Hey, look.

00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:09.850
You know, people are afraid
to speak the truth these days.

00:20:09.988 --> 00:20:11.610
Either...

00:20:11.748 --> 00:20:13.888
Because the truth either
loses or gets them canceled.

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:16.166
I mean, you’re a pastor.

00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:18.134
You’re in the business of truth.

00:20:18.272 --> 00:20:20.412
And I’m willing to bet
that you won’t run from it.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.656
We need people like you
in Congress to pass laws

00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:24.796
and make a change.

00:20:24.934 --> 00:20:29.249
What better way to make a
change than from the inside?

00:20:29.387 --> 00:20:31.112
DAVID: I don’t know, Daryl.

00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:32.942
This isn’t for me.

00:20:33.908 --> 00:20:35.910
What if it’s not about you?

00:20:38.603 --> 00:20:43.642
Look, all I ask is that
you pray on it. Okay?

00:20:57.104 --> 00:20:58.968
MONICA: There’s a sign
at the women’s center

00:20:59.106 --> 00:21:03.455
that says, "Provided by
God, through His people."

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.008
[David sighs]

00:21:05.146 --> 00:21:06.389
Who dropped the
ball, Pastor? I...

00:21:06.527 --> 00:21:08.115
I mean, I know it wasn’t God.

00:21:08.253 --> 00:21:10.013
[David sighs]

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:14.466
[sighs]

00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:16.779
Can’t win unless you play.

00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:18.988
LOTTIE: If you want to
make a real difference,

00:21:19.126 --> 00:21:20.921
this is how it’s done.

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:23.579
SMITH: People are afraid
to speak the truth these days

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:25.684
because the truth either
loses or they get canceled.

00:21:25.822 --> 00:21:28.031
LOTTIE: You think the country
really needs another politician?

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:31.380
MARTIN: Perhaps God put
those mountains in front of you

00:21:31.518 --> 00:21:34.072
to show that they can be moved.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.972
LOTTIE: Maybe it’s time
you try something new.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.216
[alarm ringing]

00:21:43.357 --> 00:21:45.463
[jet engine whooshing]

00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:54.920
[indistinct P.A. announcements]

00:22:09.003 --> 00:22:12.421
Miss Jay. Miss Jay. Miss Jay.

00:22:13.387 --> 00:22:15.251
Reverend Hill.

00:22:15.389 --> 00:22:17.426
What are you doing here?

00:22:17.564 --> 00:22:19.531
Do you really
think that I can run?

00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:21.257
[scoffs] Anyone can run.

00:22:21.395 --> 00:22:23.293
I think that you could win.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.508
Okay.

00:22:31.543 --> 00:22:32.820
Okay?

00:22:37.238 --> 00:22:38.757
We do this my way.

00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:40.759
You listen, you follow
directions, understood?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.384
Okay.

00:22:48.042 --> 00:22:49.389
What made you change your mind?

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.979
Can’t win the game
unless you play, right?

00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:59.675
All right, let’s go
save the country.

00:23:04.714 --> 00:23:07.303
Great. I’ll take
this to the board.

00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:08.580
We’ll cover the fees.

00:23:08.718 --> 00:23:09.823
Clear your calendar.

00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:11.963
Uh, for how long?

00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:15.104
With any luck, next two years.

00:23:16.864 --> 00:23:18.107
- Uh, excuse me, sir.
- DAVID: Yeah.

00:23:18.245 --> 00:23:20.765
Uh, Tom’s Trusted Transport.

00:23:20.903 --> 00:23:22.663
Please keep me in mind
for all your transport needs.

00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:24.285
Don’t I know you?

00:23:24.424 --> 00:23:25.873
Well, it’s quite possible.

00:23:26.011 --> 00:23:27.599
I’m actually a fairly
successful stage actor.

00:23:27.737 --> 00:23:28.842
Yeah.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.051
No, you’re a waiter.

00:23:32.949 --> 00:23:35.193
Well, that, too.

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:37.437
LOTTIE: Better get
some rest, Reverend Hill.

00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:38.921
Uh, everybody
just calls me David.

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:40.923
We’ll see.

00:23:50.622 --> 00:23:52.762
- [lively chatter]
- [cell phone dinging]

00:23:57.491 --> 00:23:59.182
[muttering]

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.495
He’s in. He’s in. Let’s
get to work, people.

00:24:01.633 --> 00:24:03.463
Let’s pick it up.
Let’s pick it up.

00:24:03.601 --> 00:24:04.774
- Let’s get to work, people.
- [applause, cheering]

00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:05.534
Let’s pick it up. Let’s go!

00:24:05.672 --> 00:24:07.743
[bell tolling]

00:24:16.683 --> 00:24:19.099
They found someone
to run against you.

00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:21.273
His name is David Hill.

00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:22.999
He’s a pastor. Ring a bell?

00:24:23.137 --> 00:24:24.622
KANE [over phone]:
I remember him.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.520
The Bible thumper.

00:24:26.658 --> 00:24:29.419
WESLEY: He was a juror on
that teacher case you prosecuted.

00:24:29.558 --> 00:24:31.698
[laughing]: Are we
worried about a preacher?

00:24:31.836 --> 00:24:33.493
He’s not the one
I’m worried about.

00:24:33.631 --> 00:24:35.702
We end this before it starts.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.082
Clear your morning.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.463
Get ready to do the whole

00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.051
"separation of church
and state" dance.

00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:42.812
Both barrels. I’ll
handle the rest.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.676
[sniffs]

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:49.957
MARC: [laughs] Are you sure?

00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:51.718
Yeah, I know.

00:24:51.856 --> 00:24:53.340
Yeah, he doesn’t stand
a chance against Kane

00:24:53.478 --> 00:24:54.928
without our money.

00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:57.724
Hmm? Who’s running his campaign?

00:25:02.107 --> 00:25:04.351
Okay, leave the rest to me.

00:25:04.489 --> 00:25:06.353

00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:39.938
These guys are great.

00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:41.906
Face Huckabee, your
hands on your knees.

00:25:42.044 --> 00:25:43.563
Do all the guests get
questions in advance?

00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:45.357
Today’s about first impressions.

00:25:45.495 --> 00:25:47.325
We leave nothing to chance
and you stick to the script.

00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:48.913
Don’t color outside the lines,

00:25:49.051 --> 00:25:50.949
and remember, I am
the captain of this boat.

00:25:51.087 --> 00:25:52.433
- I say...
- Stay in the boat.

00:25:52.572 --> 00:25:54.401
Stay in the boat. That’s right.

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:56.230
It’s okay. He’s got this.

00:25:56.368 --> 00:25:58.232
Well, Huckabee is an ally,
but we’re not really sure

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.372
how it’s gonna go, so we
have to make sure that...

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.616
Lord, thank You
so much for this day.

00:26:02.754 --> 00:26:04.307
Give me the words
You want me to say.

00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:06.413
We love You, Father.
In Jesus’ name.

00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:07.966
Amen.

00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:09.796
- Reverend Dave.
- Huh? Hey, what’s up?

00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:11.660
I didn’t know you
were on the show.

00:26:11.798 --> 00:26:13.282
- You guys.
- Good to see you, man.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.663
- DAVID: You guys were awesome.
- [Michael laughs]

00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:16.319
- MICHAEL: Yeah.
- DAVID: Good to see you.

00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:17.804
- Thank you so much.
- Good to see you.

00:26:17.942 --> 00:26:19.529
Are you here to talk
about your ministry?

00:26:19.668 --> 00:26:21.946
Uh, well, no, actually,
we’re here to, um...

00:26:22.084 --> 00:26:23.948
Actually, Reverend is running
for Congress in his district.

00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:25.363
- Fantastic.
- Whoa.

00:26:25.501 --> 00:26:27.020
- That’s great news.
- Excellent.

00:26:27.158 --> 00:26:28.677
So you’re here to talk
about your new ministry.

00:26:28.815 --> 00:26:31.058
- [chuckling]
- Yes.

00:26:31.196 --> 00:26:32.370
My next guest is
a small-town pastor

00:26:32.508 --> 00:26:34.234
from my home state of Arkansas.

00:26:34.372 --> 00:26:36.546
He recently spoke
before Congress,

00:26:36.685 --> 00:26:37.824
and the video
of that went viral.

00:26:37.962 --> 00:26:39.480
Give me these. You got this.

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:41.586
HUCKABEE: He’s now
a candidate for Congress.

00:26:41.724 --> 00:26:44.485
{\an8}Please join me in
giving a great welcome

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:47.040
{\an8}to Reverend David Hill.

00:26:47.178 --> 00:26:49.387
[applause]

00:26:54.944 --> 00:26:56.705
Welcome, David.

00:26:56.843 --> 00:26:58.051
- It’s great to have you here.
- [cell phone vibrating]

00:26:58.189 --> 00:26:59.328
DAVID: Thank you so
much. I appreciate it.

00:26:59.466 --> 00:27:01.054
Governor, so nice to meet you.

00:27:01.192 --> 00:27:03.263
HUCKABEE: Great to meet you.

00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:05.161
What a great crowd
we’ve got here tonight.

00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:06.922
So grateful to meet in person,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.579
and happy to have you
joining us by television.

00:27:09.718 --> 00:27:11.202
Well, David, you
know, if your experience

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.687
{\an8}is anything like mine, uh,

00:27:13.825 --> 00:27:17.208
{\an8}you’re gonna get a lot of
questions about your faith.

00:27:18.174 --> 00:27:19.279
{\an8}Ah. [sighs]

00:27:19.417 --> 00:27:21.039
{\an8}Well, I’m not quite sure why.

00:27:21.177 --> 00:27:23.248
{\an8}My job as a congressman
is to represent the people,

00:27:23.386 --> 00:27:25.526
- not to impose my faith on them.
- LOTTIE: Good.

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:27.183
Stick to the script.

00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:28.702
{\an8}Having said that,
I’m not quite sure

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.393
{\an8}how someone’s sense of morality

00:27:30.531 --> 00:27:32.292
doesn’t act as a
guidepost in public service.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.363
HUCKABEE: I-I would hope so.

00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:36.192
You know, most
people don’t understand

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:38.919
there are more ordained
ministers in Congress right now

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:41.404
than ever before in
all of American history.

00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:44.062
And that includes
both sides of the aisle.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.961
Uh, why do you
think that is, David?

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.273
Well, with everything that’s
gone on-- the pandemic,

00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:50.966
the recession,
political divide--

00:27:51.104 --> 00:27:52.968
maybe people are
looking for more spiritual

00:27:53.106 --> 00:27:55.384
and moral leadership
in Washington.

00:27:55.522 --> 00:27:57.766
We hear this phrase, and
it’ll be thrown at you a lot.

00:27:57.904 --> 00:28:00.596
What about separation
of church and state?

00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:02.356
DAVID: These days,
separation of church and state

00:28:02.494 --> 00:28:04.255
has been reduced
to a catchphrase.

00:28:04.393 --> 00:28:06.050
As much as no one
wants to admit it, the line

00:28:06.188 --> 00:28:08.569
between church and state
can be pretty blurry sometimes.

00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:10.606
HUCKABEE: Well, it
can, but if you talk like that,

00:28:10.744 --> 00:28:13.298
you’re probably gonna
get into some trouble.

00:28:13.436 --> 00:28:15.300
[chuckles] Uh,
believe me, I-I know.

00:28:15.438 --> 00:28:17.268
I guess what I’m trying
to say is we’re all made

00:28:17.406 --> 00:28:20.409
of both a mortal body
and an immortal soul.

00:28:20.547 --> 00:28:22.307
And as long as
we’re still breathing,

00:28:22.445 --> 00:28:24.585
- where do we draw that line?
- HUCKABEE: Hmm.

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:26.173
We’re gonna take a break.

00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:27.588
When we come back,
we’ve got a lot more

00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:28.589
to talk about with
Reverend Hill.

00:28:28.728 --> 00:28:30.005
Please don’t go away.

00:28:31.075 --> 00:28:34.112
[indistinct clamoring]

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.665
[shouting]

00:28:35.804 --> 00:28:37.667
Only recently, we’ve
seen what happens

00:28:37.806 --> 00:28:40.981
when our laws are
influenced by the xenophobic,

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.120
the misogynistic

00:28:42.258 --> 00:28:44.398
and intolerant extremists.

00:28:44.536 --> 00:28:46.159
People are looking for
more spiritual leadership

00:28:46.297 --> 00:28:48.402
- in Washington.
- KANE: And now...

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.128
they want to impose their views

00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:51.302
on us all.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.855
The line between
church and state

00:28:52.993 --> 00:28:54.270
can be pretty blurry sometimes.

00:28:54.408 --> 00:28:55.996
Amen.

00:28:57.342 --> 00:28:59.655
Spiritual leadership
in Washington?

00:28:59.793 --> 00:29:01.519
Christian morality?

00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:04.142
This interview was supposed
to pull you out of the fire.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.937
You threw yourself back in.

00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:08.146
What part of "stay in the
boat" do you not understand?

00:29:08.284 --> 00:29:10.114
He took what I
said out of context.

00:29:10.252 --> 00:29:12.875
Oh, really? A politician
doing something like that?

00:29:13.013 --> 00:29:16.258
You’re trying to become a
congressman, not the Pope.

00:29:16.396 --> 00:29:18.156
There’s more.

00:29:18.294 --> 00:29:20.780
He wants to do a
live podcast with you.

00:29:20.918 --> 00:29:22.540
Well, that’s good.

00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:24.335
It’ll give me an opportunity
to explain myself.

00:29:24.473 --> 00:29:26.026
- [Lottie scoffs]
- Believe me,

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:27.545
they’re not interested
in giving you anything

00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:29.512
except enough rope
for you to hang yourself.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.584
LOTTIE: Wesley’s got
something up his sleeve.

00:29:32.722 --> 00:29:34.759
Then negotiate with him.

00:29:34.897 --> 00:29:36.485
Get something in return.

00:29:37.382 --> 00:29:39.488
[insects trilling]

00:29:39.626 --> 00:29:42.318
So, they’ll do the
podcast if we agree

00:29:42.456 --> 00:29:44.493
to a debate down the road.

00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:46.012
That’s just an insurance policy

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.565
against you knocking
him out in round one.

00:29:47.703 --> 00:29:50.188
Well, that’s smart.
Let ’em have it.

00:29:50.326 --> 00:29:52.984
Uh, you know, Pete, I
wouldn’t be in a hurry

00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:55.573
to make concessions
this early in the game.

00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:57.540
I’ve already won, John.

00:29:57.678 --> 00:30:00.716
From this point on, everything
we do is just for the cameras.

00:30:00.854 --> 00:30:02.752
{\an8}[chuckles]

00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.478
{\an8}- [phone line ringing]
- CREWMAN: Little bit there.

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:07.378
{\an8}All right, we’re all set.

00:30:07.516 --> 00:30:09.035
{\an8}Larry, thank you for
putting this together

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:10.899
{\an8}- at the last minute.
- Hey, not a problem at all.

00:30:11.037 --> 00:30:12.624
{\an8}- Thank you for picking my show.
- [cell phone vibrating]

00:30:12.762 --> 00:30:14.350
{\an8}You good? Can I
get you anything else?

00:30:14.488 --> 00:30:15.662
{\an8}- KANE: No, I’m fine. Thank you.
- LARRY: Okay.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.043
{\an8}All right. I think we’re ready.

00:30:17.181 --> 00:30:18.768
{\an8}[line ringing]

00:30:18.907 --> 00:30:19.977
{\an8}WESLEY [recorded]:
You’ve reached John Wesley.

00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:21.150
{\an8}- You know what to do.
- [sighs]

00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:22.600
{\an8}Hope I’m doing this right.

00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:23.739
{\an8}I’ve only ever done
my own makeup.

00:30:23.877 --> 00:30:25.258
{\an8}Uh, I’m sure it’s fine.

00:30:25.396 --> 00:30:26.880
{\an8}All right, this is not
what we agreed to.

00:30:27.018 --> 00:30:29.158
{\an8}He’s supposed to be
in the studio with Kane.

00:30:32.368 --> 00:30:34.681
{\an8}What do you say we
keep our religious beliefs

00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:37.649
{\an8}to ourselves today,
okay, Reverend?

00:30:37.787 --> 00:30:39.444
{\an8}What do you say?

00:30:39.582 --> 00:30:41.136
{\an8}CREWMAN: Okay,
here we go. Live in ten.

00:30:41.274 --> 00:30:42.862
{\an8}AMANDA: Sorry.

00:30:44.587 --> 00:30:46.417
{\an8}It’s gonna be fine.

00:30:46.555 --> 00:30:48.350
{\an8}- [chuckles]
- CREWMAN: Okay, going live.

00:30:48.488 --> 00:30:50.559
{\an8}KANE [over speaker]: ...where
I served as district attorney

00:30:50.697 --> 00:30:52.941
{\an8}and then in the Arkansas
House of Representatives.

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:55.150
{\an8}And after that, I was
elected to the state senate,

00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:56.945
{\an8}where I served as
senate minority leader.

00:30:57.083 --> 00:30:59.257
{\an8}Very impressive résumé, Senator.

00:30:59.395 --> 00:31:01.156
{\an8}- [chuckles] Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:05.332
{\an8}And you, Mr. Hill, says
here that you’re a preacher.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.609
{\an8}Yes.

00:31:06.747 --> 00:31:08.715
{\an8}Uh, I’m a reverend at St. Jude.

00:31:08.853 --> 00:31:11.062
{\an8}Right. Sure. And now
you’re running for Congress.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.753
{\an8}That’s correct.

00:31:12.892 --> 00:31:15.756
{\an8}Well, I go to church,
and I’ve got a pastor,

00:31:15.895 --> 00:31:17.448
{\an8}but, uh, I don’t think

00:31:17.586 --> 00:31:19.243
{\an8}- I’d vote for him, you know?
- [Kane chuckling]

00:31:19.381 --> 00:31:21.038
{\an8}Is your pastor
running for office?

00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:22.971
{\an8}[laughs] No, but...

00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:25.214
{\an8}DAVID: Then it probably won’t
be an issue for either of you.

00:31:25.352 --> 00:31:26.595
{\an8}- Nice.
- KANE: No, I think that Larry

00:31:26.733 --> 00:31:28.493
{\an8}is just pointing out
the obvious here,

00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:31.841
{\an8}that clergy in politics
is a controversial topic,

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.602
{\an8}even amongst Christians.

00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:36.916
{\an8}Founding fathers were
clear about their intentions

00:31:37.054 --> 00:31:39.401
{\an8}concerning the separation
of church and state.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:40.920
{\an8}It wasn’t so much about

00:31:41.058 --> 00:31:42.714
{\an8}keeping religion out
of the government.

00:31:42.852 --> 00:31:44.889
{\an8}It was more about keeping
the government out of religion.

00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:47.788
{\an8}This sounds more like,
uh, your interpretation.

00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:51.033
{\an8}I-I will add, um,

00:31:51.171 --> 00:31:53.622
{\an8}Christians who are
politically active must be led

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.175
{\an8}by biblical
principles and values

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:57.281
{\an8}and not by party affiliation.

00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:59.179
{\an8}Oh, so now you’re saying that

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:02.010
{\an8}these biblical principles
of yours would influence

00:32:02.148 --> 00:32:03.873
{\an8}- your decision making?
- No.

00:32:04.012 --> 00:32:05.530
{\an8}Of course.

00:32:05.668 --> 00:32:07.291
{\an8}KANE: And so, by your
own admission, then,

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:10.294
{\an8}you would craft laws and
policies based on superstition,

00:32:10.432 --> 00:32:14.608
{\an8}irrationality, fear
and ignorance.

00:32:17.128 --> 00:32:19.751
{\an8}Suffice to say, I-I
don’t see it that way.

00:32:19.889 --> 00:32:21.788
{\an8}Suffice it to say that the
good people of Arkansas

00:32:21.926 --> 00:32:25.550
{\an8}will once again be held captive
by one of your interpretations.

00:32:25.688 --> 00:32:28.691
{\an8}This country should be run
by scholars and academics,

00:32:28.829 --> 00:32:31.901
{\an8}not by people who are
afraid of a bogeyman.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.663
{\an8}This man, he could not
represent the electorate

00:32:34.801 --> 00:32:37.838
{\an8}in a levelheaded,
rational, impartial manner.

00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:40.151
{\an8}And on a personal note,

00:32:40.289 --> 00:32:45.122
{\an8}I find your moral superiority
and smugness offensive.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.746
{\an8}Who died and left you
arbiter of right and wrong?

00:32:51.024 --> 00:32:52.819
Fine. That’s a wrap.

00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:55.684
[chuckling]: Very
well said, Senator.

00:32:55.822 --> 00:32:57.134
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [light applause]

00:32:57.272 --> 00:32:58.963
Thank you so much.
That was amazing.

00:32:59.101 --> 00:33:00.516
Well, most Christians
are believers

00:33:00.654 --> 00:33:02.415
because they
know they’re broken,

00:33:02.553 --> 00:33:05.245
and the only hope they
have is Jesus Christ.

00:33:05.383 --> 00:33:06.591
LOTTIE: Please stop talking.

00:33:06.729 --> 00:33:08.352
The messenger may
stumble, Mr. Kane,

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.078
but it doesn’t
negate the message.

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:12.080
They’ve turned off your mic.

00:33:12.218 --> 00:33:14.910
We’ve been set up. It’s over.

00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:23.539
- [sighs heavily]
- [cell phone whooshing]

00:33:23.677 --> 00:33:25.024
Oh, no.

00:33:25.162 --> 00:33:27.854
- No, no, no, no. No.
- [door closes]

00:33:29.683 --> 00:33:31.271
He’s winning.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:33.411
They’re putting way more
into this than I expected.

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:35.413
DAVID: So what’s the big
deal? We’ll bounce back.

00:33:35.551 --> 00:33:38.244
The campaign that
spends the most wins.

00:33:38.382 --> 00:33:40.039
And we wonder why our
country has so many problems.

00:33:40.177 --> 00:33:41.419
All of this money for what?

00:33:41.557 --> 00:33:43.559
To make the country like me?

00:33:43.697 --> 00:33:46.424
No, it’s to make
them dislike Kane.

00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:48.323
That’s how we close the gap.

00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:50.256
So the goal of the
campaign is to make voters

00:33:50.394 --> 00:33:52.568
dislike Peter Kane more
than they dislike me.

00:33:52.706 --> 00:33:53.983
This is the reality.

00:33:54.122 --> 00:33:55.571
If I can’t get them
to vote for you,

00:33:55.709 --> 00:33:57.470
I keep them from
voting for Kane.

00:33:57.608 --> 00:33:59.575
I didn’t get into politics
to behave like a politician.

00:33:59.713 --> 00:34:01.612
You want me to
let you dig up dirt.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.270
Oh, no. I want you
to let me do my job.

00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:06.134
I know people who
can find dirt on Kane,

00:34:06.272 --> 00:34:08.446
and you can’t be afraid
to risk rolling in the mud.

00:34:08.584 --> 00:34:10.069
That’s the easy part, Miss Jay.

00:34:10.207 --> 00:34:11.898
The hard part’s
getting clean again.

00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:14.245
Well, as sad as it
might sound to you,

00:34:14.383 --> 00:34:17.628
it’s the only way we’re
gonna beat John Wesley.

00:34:19.285 --> 00:34:20.803
SAM: Um, John Wesley?

00:34:20.941 --> 00:34:22.874
She meant to say Kane, right?

00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:25.325
What is it with her
and John Wesley?

00:34:28.052 --> 00:34:29.502
Several years ago, I had--

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.469
and this is before
you joined the firm--

00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:33.816
I had sent Lottie to
run a congressional

00:34:33.954 --> 00:34:35.818
against John Wesley.

00:34:35.956 --> 00:34:39.339
She was a rising star, and
Wesley was already an icon,

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.272
and things happened.

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.931
Uh, she thought of
him as a mentor, a...

00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:49.970
a trusted friend, and he
just thought of her as a...

00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:51.351
Distraction.

00:34:52.663 --> 00:34:56.184
And as it turns out, a
convenient way for Wesley

00:34:56.322 --> 00:34:58.738
to gather intel
on his opposition.

00:34:58.876 --> 00:35:00.912
Well, of course,
Lottie’s candidate lost,

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.156
and everyone in
town blamed her for it.

00:35:03.294 --> 00:35:05.848
Wesley rode off into
the sunset a winner,

00:35:05.986 --> 00:35:07.816
and the disgraced Lottie Jay

00:35:07.954 --> 00:35:12.131
disappeared, ending a
very promising career.

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:17.101
[sighs] Come on.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:18.792
[grunts]

00:35:21.968 --> 00:35:24.557
[breathing heavily]

00:35:34.153 --> 00:35:36.362
[cell phone vibrating]

00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:41.298
[sighs]

00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:45.923
- Hello.
- WESLEY: Have you tried

00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:48.201
the chocolate gravy
they have here?

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:50.065
I mean, I get it,
people like chocolate,

00:35:50.203 --> 00:35:52.240
and gravy makes
everything taste better,

00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:54.207
but chocolate gravy?

00:35:54.345 --> 00:35:55.933
It’s an abomination.

00:35:57.245 --> 00:36:01.421
People should learn when to
quit and leave well enough alone.

00:36:03.216 --> 00:36:05.494
Don’t you think?

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:08.842
Anyway, listen.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.673
Beautiful, I am starving.

00:36:11.811 --> 00:36:14.054
So what do you say
we find a barbecue place

00:36:14.193 --> 00:36:15.746
in a sleazy part of town

00:36:15.884 --> 00:36:18.162
and pretend neither of
us are who we say we are

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.681
and see where
the night takes us?

00:36:19.819 --> 00:36:22.546
We agreed to a real
debate. You owe me.

00:36:22.684 --> 00:36:24.237
That’s not gonna happen.

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.652
What are you so afraid of?

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.482
[chuckling]: "Afraid."

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.656
See, that’s just the thing.
I have nothing to fear.

00:36:29.794 --> 00:36:33.867
All I have to do is sit back
and watch you spiral again.

MARC: I’m sure you’ll agree
we have common interests.

00:37:12.251 --> 00:37:15.944
A partnership seems
mutually beneficial.

00:37:16.082 --> 00:37:17.635
If you’ve already broken ground,

00:37:17.773 --> 00:37:20.086
then why do you need a
congressman in your pocket?

00:37:20.224 --> 00:37:22.088
Well, someone on the inside

00:37:22.226 --> 00:37:25.988
to cut through all the red tape
so we can finish construction.

00:37:26.126 --> 00:37:29.647
My partners and I don’t need
to be burdened with permits,

00:37:29.785 --> 00:37:33.168
filing deadlines, inspections,
all of the roadblocks

00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:35.170
that strangle progress.

00:37:35.308 --> 00:37:37.724
I heard Rick West wasn’t
interested in your money.

00:37:37.862 --> 00:37:39.554
And I heard you had none.

00:37:40.624 --> 00:37:44.283
Hmm. We both know that
you’re losing truckloads of cash

00:37:44.421 --> 00:37:47.113
each day that this
project is stalled.

00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:49.667
You’ve made assurances
that you can’t keep.

00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:53.809
And you don’t have a
prayer without my money.

00:37:53.947 --> 00:37:58.400
Like I said,
mutually beneficial.

00:37:59.194 --> 00:38:01.472
Well, either way, it’s illegal
to influence a campaign.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.163
If we do agree to this,

00:38:03.302 --> 00:38:04.993
I don’t want you even
talking to Reverend Hill.

00:38:05.131 --> 00:38:06.650
Fine. Fine.

00:38:06.788 --> 00:38:09.377
But then it’s on you to
keep your boy in line.

00:38:09.515 --> 00:38:12.690
’Cause much like
his God, I can giveth

00:38:12.828 --> 00:38:14.830

fund your entire campaign,

00:38:22.182 --> 00:38:23.632

00:38:31.122 --> 00:38:32.883
More money?

00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:34.505
Without it, there’s
zero chance of winning.

00:38:34.643 --> 00:38:36.438

on a celebratory dinner tonight

00:38:38.682 --> 00:38:41.650

to the emergency ward?

00:38:42.651 --> 00:38:43.997
Emergency ward?

00:38:44.135 --> 00:38:45.965

on life support.

00:38:46.103 --> 00:38:47.207

- LOTTIE: Little worse, maybe.

00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:10.127
Nothing Marc’s money can’t fix.

00:39:12.405 --> 00:39:14.718
How does the
money get paid back?

00:39:14.856 --> 00:39:17.099
Well, it’s wrapped up in a
C4 social welfare organization.

00:39:17.237 --> 00:39:20.448
Doesn’t even have to
be spent on the campaign.

00:39:20.586 --> 00:39:24.244
You know, if you talked
a little bit less about God

00:39:24.383 --> 00:39:26.868
and a little bit more
on the dirt on Kane,

00:39:27.006 --> 00:39:29.422
we might actually have a chance.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.217
You want me to take
God out of the discussion

00:39:31.355 --> 00:39:33.392
and replace Him with dirt?

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.255
I know my job.

00:39:35.394 --> 00:39:36.947
And I know it’s useless
to fight dark with darkness.

00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:39.950
It’s the same idea with
you and John Wesley.

00:39:41.503 --> 00:39:43.885

move on with your life.

But your life’s here, Lottie.

00:41:27.506 --> 00:41:29.369
You of all people
should understand.

00:41:29.508 --> 00:41:32.545
I understand... it takes
strength to forgive.

00:41:32.683 --> 00:41:35.790
How am I supposed to forgive
when he’s not even sorry?

{\an8}KANE: There’s no place
for a pastor in politics.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.991
{\an8}There’s no place for
God in Washington.

00:46:41.129 --> 00:46:43.856
{\an8}Keep your morality in the
church and stay out of D.C.

00:46:43.994 --> 00:46:45.271
{\an8}I now realize that
your issue isn’t

00:46:45.409 --> 00:46:46.963
{\an8}whether or not the
government needs God.

00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:48.585
{\an8}It’s that you believe
the government is God.

00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:50.898
{\an8}No, the role of government
is to make lives better.

00:46:51.036 --> 00:46:52.727
{\an8}Why do you have
a problem with that?

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.902
{\an8}I don’t, but I do have a problem

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.386
{\an8}- with big government.
- You do.

00:46:56.524 --> 00:46:58.077
{\an8}- It spreads like a cancer.
- Oh, please.

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.700
{\an8}Government allocates
money to help people.

00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:03.427
{\an8}Yes, but to give, the
government must first take.

00:47:03.565 --> 00:47:06.154
{\an8}It’s a cycle that breeds
dependency, not solutions.

00:47:06.292 --> 00:47:08.053
{\an8}Oh, you think your church
groups could do it better?

00:47:08.191 --> 00:47:11.228
{\an8}The church fills gaps the
government can’t in many ways,

00:47:11.366 --> 00:47:13.368
{\an8}especially in moral guidance.

00:47:13.506 --> 00:47:15.198
{\an8}[chuckling]: Moral
guidance. Uh-huh.

00:47:15.336 --> 00:47:19.478
{\an8}See, he’s saying that the
state needs the church.

00:47:19.616 --> 00:47:22.032
{\an8}Textbook example of
Christian nationalism.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.620
{\an8}That’s not fair, Senator.

00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:24.966
{\an8}[chuckling]: No,
it is fair. It’s true.

00:47:25.104 --> 00:47:27.072
{\an8}Whenever anyone of
faith promotes a policy

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.557
{\an8}that you don’t like, you label
them a Christian nationalist.

00:47:29.695 --> 00:47:32.767
{\an8}Consider a Christian school
board member who opposes books

00:47:32.905 --> 00:47:34.976
{\an8}that they find
inappropriate for kids.

00:47:35.114 --> 00:47:37.979
{\an8}Is she a nationalist or
just a concerned parent?

00:47:38.117 --> 00:47:39.394
{\an8}[laughing]: Where
are you getting all this?

00:47:39.532 --> 00:47:41.258
{\an8}Or what about the
high school coach

00:47:41.396 --> 00:47:43.743
{\an8}who invites players to join in
on a prayer after the game?

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:45.573
{\an8}Is this nationalism?

00:47:45.711 --> 00:47:47.368
{\an8}- I appreciate your passion.
- Or just a-a man who wants

00:47:47.506 --> 00:47:49.473
{\an8}to thank God for the
opportunity to play?

00:47:49.611 --> 00:47:51.096
{\an8}- THOMPSON: Mr. Hill.
- I’m not talking about coaches.

00:47:51.234 --> 00:47:52.476
{\an8}I appreciate your
passion, but let’s shift

00:47:52.614 --> 00:47:54.064
{\an8}- to a topic...
- Is he nationalist?

00:47:54.202 --> 00:47:55.583
{\an8}So let’s pivot to a
subject that affects

00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:57.343
{\an8}all of our viewers: health care.

00:47:57.481 --> 00:47:59.932
{\an8}Millions of Americans
are left without it.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.348
{\an8}Senator, what would
your solutions be?

00:48:02.486 --> 00:48:05.593
{\an8}Well, yes, I think that
health care is a right

00:48:05.731 --> 00:48:07.767
{\an8}and not a privilege.

00:48:07.906 --> 00:48:10.391
{\an8}We depend on government
action to provide it universally.

00:48:10.529 --> 00:48:12.048
{\an8}DAVID: And pile on more debt.

00:48:12.186 --> 00:48:14.395
{\an8}Senator, we need solutions

00:48:14.533 --> 00:48:16.259
{\an8}that empower people,
not bankrupt our country.

00:48:16.397 --> 00:48:17.639
{\an8}You don’t know
anything about the debt.

00:48:17.777 --> 00:48:19.538
{\an8}I know we should spend less.

00:48:19.676 --> 00:48:22.334
{\an8}So you would deny people
health care because of the cost?

00:48:22.472 --> 00:48:24.336
{\an8}- That’s not what I said.
- That’s your Christian charity?

00:48:24.474 --> 00:48:26.303
{\an8}That’s not what I said. We
need efficient, affordable care.

00:48:26.441 --> 00:48:28.616
{\an8}And where do we get
that, your collection plate?

00:48:28.754 --> 00:48:31.653
{\an8}You see, th-that’s
the crux of this, Dan.

00:48:31.791 --> 00:48:33.172
{\an8}He and people like
him, th-they think

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.967
{\an8}that their beliefs
should dictate our laws.

00:48:35.105 --> 00:48:36.865
{\an8}Christians don’t believe that.

00:48:37.004 --> 00:48:38.315
{\an8}- And that’s wrong.
- Christians don’t believe that.

00:48:38.453 --> 00:48:39.834
{\an8}Yes, they do.

00:48:39.972 --> 00:48:41.353
{\an8}Then you’re missing
the point, Senator.

00:48:41.491 --> 00:48:42.837
{\an8}Our nation was founded
on Christian principles.

00:48:42.975 --> 00:48:44.459
{\an8}KANE [laughing]: "On
Christian principles."

00:48:44.597 --> 00:48:46.116
{\an8}It seems we’ve, uh,
heard that one before.

00:48:46.254 --> 00:48:47.704
{\an8}Well, I hate to break it to you,

00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:50.189
{\an8}but the idea that this
is a Christian nation,

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:52.398
{\an8}that’s more myth than history.

00:48:52.536 --> 00:48:54.538
{\an8}"One nation under God."

00:48:54.676 --> 00:48:56.851
{\an8}That wasn’t added into
our Pledge of Allegiance

00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:58.715
{\an8}until the 1950s.

00:48:58.853 --> 00:48:59.888
{\an8}It actually started
with Abraham Lincoln

00:49:00.027 --> 00:49:01.476
{\an8}and the Gettysburg Address.

00:49:01.614 --> 00:49:03.030
{\an8}And the phrase printed
on all of our money,

00:49:03.168 --> 00:49:04.686
{\an8}"in God we trust"?

00:49:04.824 --> 00:49:06.723
{\an8}Again, the 1950s.

00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:08.173
{\an8}If our currency
offends you so much,

00:49:08.311 --> 00:49:09.657
{\an8}- why not spend less of it?
- [Kane chuckles]

00:49:09.795 --> 00:49:11.003
{\an8}Not only would
you learn to save,

00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:12.556
{\an8}but you might
just learn the value

00:49:12.694 --> 00:49:14.489
{\an8}of self-reliance versus
government dependency.

00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:16.146
{\an8}Oh, excellent retort.

00:49:16.284 --> 00:49:18.528
{\an8}And while our money
says, "in God we trust,"

00:49:18.666 --> 00:49:20.323
{\an8}it’s clear where
your trust lies:

00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:21.876
{\an8}in the pursuit of power

00:49:22.014 --> 00:49:24.672
{\an8}and not in the principles
that shaped this nation.

00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:32.507
{\an8}CREWMAN: Go to
commercial. Commercial.

00:49:32.645 --> 00:49:34.406
{\an8}Let’s go to commercial.
Go commercial.

00:49:34.544 --> 00:49:37.443
{\an8}We’ll be back
after a short break.

00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:40.136
{\an8}CREWMAN: And we’re clear.

00:49:40.274 --> 00:49:41.516
{\an8}Two minutes. Last looks.

00:49:41.654 --> 00:49:42.966
{\an8}Dan, get in here.

00:49:44.243 --> 00:49:46.107
{\an8}Much better than the
podcast. I really love the fire.

00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:48.247
{\an8}But you’ve got to
tone down the God talk

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:49.766
{\an8}for the mainstream audience.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:51.561
{\an8}You’re starting to
sound like Kane.

00:49:51.699 --> 00:49:53.632
{\an8}And you’re making God an
easy target for them, Pastor.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.979
{\an8}God’s not the
target. Our country is.

00:49:56.117 --> 00:49:58.050
{\an8}God’s just standing
in their way.

00:49:58.188 --> 00:49:59.879
{\an8}Look, in order to capitalize
on the momentum,

00:50:00.018 --> 00:50:02.675
{\an8}you got to drop God
and we got to go negative.

00:50:03.745 --> 00:50:06.783
{\an8}Negative campaigns
work. They win.

00:50:14.204 --> 00:50:16.241
{\an8}- Senator.
- Making a spectacle of me

00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:19.244
{\an8}in front of the television
audience, huh?

00:50:19.382 --> 00:50:22.212
{\an8}Framing your agenda
as the moral compass?

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.284
{\an8}- Senator, the debate...
- Quiet! Listen to me.

00:50:26.285 --> 00:50:29.944
{\an8}I will not be made
a fool of, not by you.

00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:33.568
{\an8}I’m gonna change the
landscape, Reverend.

00:50:35.225 --> 00:50:37.745
{\an8}This debate, that
was just the beginning.

00:50:37.883 --> 00:50:42.025
{\an8}I won’t stop until your
so-called moral high ground

00:50:42.163 --> 00:50:44.579
{\an8}crumbles beneath your feet.

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:51.414
{\an8}Remember this moment
when you and your beliefs

00:50:51.552 --> 00:50:53.864
{\an8}were on the wrong
side of history.

00:51:01.769 --> 00:51:03.840
{\an8}You know, this race is
getting more attention

00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.428
{\an8}- than it deserves.
- Well, voters...

00:51:05.566 --> 00:51:07.464
{\an8}KANE: You need
to learn to relax.

00:51:07.602 --> 00:51:09.949
{\an8}Hill is done.

00:51:10.088 --> 00:51:11.848
{\an8}It’s over.

00:51:11.986 --> 00:51:13.470
{\an8}DAVID [over TV]: ...it’s
clear where your trust lies:

00:51:13.608 --> 00:51:15.783
{\an8}in the pursuit of power
and not in the principles

00:51:15.921 --> 00:51:18.096
{\an8}that shaped this nation.

00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:21.651
{\an8}...where your trust lies:
in the pursuit of power

00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:24.481
{\an8}and not in the principles
that shaped this nation.

00:51:24.619 --> 00:51:26.483
{\an8}What?

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:29.486
{\an8}What’s the problem, John?

00:51:29.624 --> 00:51:31.661
{\an8}They’re about to go negative.

00:51:32.972 --> 00:51:36.044
{\an8}Because once they figure it out,

00:51:36.183 --> 00:51:38.599
{\an8}they’ll realize it’s
their only move.

00:51:40.118 --> 00:51:41.636
{\an8}Figure what out?

00:51:42.603 --> 00:51:44.467
{\an8}That they can win.

00:51:47.263 --> 00:51:49.644
{\an8}Lottie will dig until
she finds something.

00:51:49.782 --> 00:51:52.613
{\an8}Is there anything I should know?

00:51:53.441 --> 00:51:57.687
{\an8}It’s the holier-than-thou
crowd that has so much to hide.

00:51:57.825 --> 00:51:59.723
{\an8}My record is impeccable.

00:52:00.724 --> 00:52:02.347
{\an8}What if it wasn’t?

00:52:02.485 --> 00:52:03.486
{\an8}REPORTER [over TV]: Most
discussions have centered

00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:05.073
{\an8}around Hill’s last comment,

00:52:05.212 --> 00:52:06.489
{\an8}where he questioned
Kane’s principles.

00:52:06.627 --> 00:52:08.698
{\an8}Some have
speculated this indicates

00:52:08.836 --> 00:52:11.390
{\an8}the Hill campaign may have
found dirt on Senator Kane,

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.634
{\an8}but for now, all we
can do is wonder,

00:52:13.772 --> 00:52:16.775
{\an8}what does Mr. Hill
know that we don’t?

00:52:22.298 --> 00:52:23.816
{\an8}SMITH [recorded]: Hi.
You’ve reached the office

00:52:23.954 --> 00:52:25.404
{\an8}of Congressman Daryl Smith.

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.234
{\an8}Please leave a message.

00:52:27.372 --> 00:52:29.063
{\an8}Hey, Congressman Smith.

00:52:29.201 --> 00:52:31.203
{\an8}It’s David Hill.

00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:32.825
{\an8}[sighs]

00:52:32.963 --> 00:52:34.896
{\an8}Look, I, uh...

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.417
{\an8}I don’t know what I’m doing.

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:41.455
{\an8}I feel like I have two options:
I can either do the things

00:52:41.593 --> 00:52:44.423
{\an8}that I feel like God
asked me not to,

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.805
{\an8}or I lose this race.

00:52:48.703 --> 00:52:51.879
{\an8}You can call me back when
you get a chance. Thanks.

00:52:53.052 --> 00:52:54.916
{\an8}[sets down phone]

00:52:55.054 --> 00:52:57.056
{\an8}[sighs]

00:52:57.885 --> 00:52:59.231
{\an8}LOTTIE: Have you found
any surrogate writers

00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:00.612
{\an8}for the website yet?

00:53:02.165 --> 00:53:03.753
{\an8}Well, then make them up.

00:53:03.891 --> 00:53:06.859
{\an8}I want at least 30 websites
to link back to ours.

00:53:10.415 --> 00:53:12.313
Well, make those up, too.

00:53:12.451 --> 00:53:14.108
I got to go. Bye.

00:53:14.246 --> 00:53:16.214
[door closes]

00:53:19.009 --> 00:53:20.632
Ugh.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.703
[cell phone dinging]

00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:29.951
Oh.

00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:35.405
WOMAN: There was nothing,
then all of a sudden, there was this.

00:53:36.234 --> 00:53:38.477
Is this the smoking
gun that I hope it is?

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:41.446
That and so much more. I
don’t know how I missed it.

00:53:41.584 --> 00:53:43.448
Well, we’re not all perfect.

00:53:43.586 --> 00:53:45.933
No, what I’m saying is I
don’t know how I missed it.

00:53:46.071 --> 00:53:48.832
Something’s not right,
Lottie. It feels wrong.

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.490
I just need it to be right
enough to get me seven points.

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:53.492
Careful, Lottie.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.460
There are things
worse than losing.

00:53:55.598 --> 00:53:59.222
Not really. Not really.

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.510
[takes deep breath]

00:54:15.618 --> 00:54:18.517
Okay, I’ll bite. What’s this?

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.001
Your golden ticket.

00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:24.178
When our mutual friend was
at the District Attorney’s Office,

00:54:24.316 --> 00:54:27.664
he successfully prosecuted
a money laundering case.

00:54:27.802 --> 00:54:29.770
First-degree class B felony,

00:54:29.908 --> 00:54:32.462
up to 25 years in prison,
even at the state level.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.981
- Okay.
- After three hours

00:54:34.119 --> 00:54:36.190
of deliberation, a jury
found the defendant

00:54:36.328 --> 00:54:37.985
guilty as charged.

00:54:38.123 --> 00:54:42.058
The sentence: six
months time served.

00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:46.476
These are the wire transfers
from Kane’s offshore accounts.

00:54:46.614 --> 00:54:49.341
These outgoing
wires to the judge.

00:54:49.479 --> 00:54:51.792
Bribery of a public official,

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.450
conspiracy to commit
bribery, malfeasance in office.

00:54:54.588 --> 00:54:56.521
[chuckling]: It’s
all right here.

00:54:56.659 --> 00:54:58.350
We’re not having
this conversation.

00:54:58.488 --> 00:55:01.180
Ten seconds after the
press gets it, it’s over.

00:55:01.319 --> 00:55:03.562
No more campaign,
no more debate.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.288
We all get to go home, and you,

00:55:05.426 --> 00:55:08.740
you get to be Saint
Dave the Congressman.

00:55:08.878 --> 00:55:11.087
I’ve been telling people
that my candidacy

00:55:11.225 --> 00:55:13.400
is about more than
winning the election.

00:55:13.538 --> 00:55:16.472
If I release this to the media,

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:19.026
then my promise was
nothing more than a slogan.

00:55:19.164 --> 00:55:22.581
You don’t win unless
you play by their rules.

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:24.997
I’ve already lost if I do.

00:55:25.135 --> 00:55:27.655
Please, destroy this.

00:55:27.793 --> 00:55:29.692
No one else sees it.

00:55:41.773 --> 00:55:43.395
Fine.

00:55:46.847 --> 00:55:48.780
[Sam clears throat]

00:55:53.025 --> 00:55:54.751
[cell phone vibrating]

00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:57.823
[gate opens]

00:55:57.961 --> 00:55:59.238
DAVID: Monica.

00:56:00.585 --> 00:56:02.380
Hey. I am so sorry.

00:56:02.518 --> 00:56:05.348
The campaign has been pulling
me in a thousand directions.

00:56:05.486 --> 00:56:06.832
What’s going on?

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:08.489
Some folks from the
government dropped by

00:56:08.627 --> 00:56:10.940
and told us we need to
pack up by week’s end.

00:56:11.078 --> 00:56:13.977
That’s just... It’s
in a couple of days.

00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:15.669
I’m scared, Pastor.

00:56:15.807 --> 00:56:17.602
Where will we go?

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.535
Thought we’d have more
time, but I’ll make some calls

00:56:19.673 --> 00:56:21.537
when I get back to the office.
This campaign, it’s just...

00:56:21.675 --> 00:56:23.987
Your campaign should not
come at the cost of our safety.

00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:25.472
You’ve let this happen.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:27.059
You’re too caught
up in your future

00:56:27.197 --> 00:56:29.372
to see our present
is falling apart.

00:56:32.996 --> 00:56:35.240
I’m sorry.

00:56:35.378 --> 00:56:37.311
It’s just...

00:56:38.899 --> 00:56:41.522
...these families,
they’ve... [sighs]

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:46.320
...barely begun to feel
safe for the first time, and...

00:56:46.458 --> 00:56:48.736
now they might lose that, too.

00:56:50.186 --> 00:56:52.153
God provides through His people.

00:56:56.192 --> 00:56:57.918
But where are they?

00:57:04.994 --> 00:57:06.789
[baby crying nearby]

00:57:14.866 --> 00:57:17.765
[thunder rumbling]

00:57:22.632 --> 00:57:25.428
Hey. I wanted to tell you I
saw your debate with Kane,

00:57:25.566 --> 00:57:27.672
and I was very impressed.

00:57:28.535 --> 00:57:31.020
Thank you. I-I hope
I earned your vote.

00:57:31.158 --> 00:57:32.677
Yeah, no, I don’t vote.

00:57:32.815 --> 00:57:34.817
Voting doesn’t really
change anything.

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:36.819
Okay.

00:57:36.957 --> 00:57:39.269
But I will join your church.

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:42.031
Okay, see you at noon.

00:57:46.173 --> 00:57:47.692
REPORTER [over TV]:
Campaign manager John Wesley

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.556
has prepared a statement.

00:57:49.694 --> 00:57:52.731
WESLEY [over TV]: Now,
I’m holding sworn affidavits

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:55.734
signed by the bank’s
board of trustees

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.356
that irrefutably demonstrate

00:57:57.495 --> 00:58:00.739
that the account
numbers in question

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.672
{\an8}are completely fabricated.

00:58:03.708 --> 00:58:06.642
{\an8}Therefore-- and-and
this is important...

00:58:07.505 --> 00:58:11.716
{\an8}...the wires that
the Hill campaign

00:58:11.854 --> 00:58:17.687
accused Senator Kane
of sending and receiving

00:58:17.825 --> 00:58:20.207
could not possibly have
come from their bank.

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:24.970
The documents that Mr. Hill
released to the press--

00:58:25.108 --> 00:58:28.836
that were released to
you-- were all forgeries.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.459
{\an8}They were forged.

00:58:31.598 --> 00:58:33.600
- [reporters clamoring]
- WESLEY: On another note,

00:58:33.738 --> 00:58:35.394
Senator Kane would like to
express his deep disappointment

00:58:35.533 --> 00:58:38.536
not only for the Hill campaign
and its staff members

00:58:38.674 --> 00:58:40.917
whose desperation
in the final days

00:58:41.055 --> 00:58:42.954
led them to this
libelous pursuit

00:58:43.092 --> 00:58:45.577
but also to the good
people of Arkansas

00:58:46.405 --> 00:58:51.134
{\an8}who have had their
faith in Reverend Hill

00:58:51.272 --> 00:58:52.757
once again shattered.

00:58:52.895 --> 00:58:55.000
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:58:55.138 --> 00:58:59.073
...who have had their
faith in Reverend Hill

00:58:59.211 --> 00:59:01.179
once again shattered.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.424
Thank you, lad...

00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:09.428
[remote control drops on table]

00:59:10.671 --> 00:59:12.431
[scoffs]

00:59:15.365 --> 00:59:16.643
I know how this looks.

00:59:18.472 --> 00:59:19.991
It was obviously a setup.

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:22.303
How could John have come up

00:59:22.441 --> 00:59:24.582
with so much contrary
evidence so fast?

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:29.448
Oh, I admit I took the bait.

00:59:30.415 --> 00:59:32.693
I didn’t leak it to the press.

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.733
Myra, tell him.

00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:40.183
Tell him what type of
man John Wesley is.

00:59:40.321 --> 00:59:42.254
I wouldn’t do this.

00:59:49.676 --> 00:59:51.401
[sighs softly]

00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:54.922
I’ll hand in my
resignation tomorrow.

00:59:59.168 --> 01:00:02.861
Well, at least she
gets to go home now.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.036
[snickers]

01:00:05.174 --> 01:00:07.003
You can quit, too, Sam,

01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:09.247
if that’s all the compassion
you have for your colleague.

01:00:11.663 --> 01:00:13.251
Okay.

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:25.332
[drops bag on chair]

01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:32.201
[phone ringing]

01:00:32.339 --> 01:00:34.306
WESLEY: He hasn’t
dropped out of the race yet.

01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:36.205
Huh?

01:00:36.343 --> 01:00:38.034
But I’m sure he fired Lottie
and the rest of his staff,

01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:39.760
which is a beautiful thing.

01:00:39.898 --> 01:00:41.417
- [Kane chuckling]
- Hill can’t come back from this.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.730
- You’re quite the genius, John.
- Thank you.

01:00:43.868 --> 01:00:46.594
I mean, it was a brilliant
plan, executed perfectly.

01:00:46.733 --> 01:00:48.424
I’m only disappointed
that I won’t get a chance

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.082
to debate him and strike
the death blow myself.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.393
- [chuckling]
- Cheers.

01:00:52.531 --> 01:00:54.395
PUNDIT: At the very least,

01:00:54.533 --> 01:00:56.432
it’s likely that she’s
been fired from the team.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.054
At this point, I don’t see

01:00:58.192 --> 01:00:59.573
[over TV]: any
other option for Hill

01:00:59.711 --> 01:01:01.126
- but to suspend his
campaign - [phone ringing]

01:01:01.264 --> 01:01:03.922
and salvage even
a shred of dignity.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.338
It’s still uncertain if he
knew the information

01:01:06.476 --> 01:01:08.099
in the press leak
was fabricated,

01:01:08.237 --> 01:01:10.895
but either way, it would
be wise to concede

01:01:11.033 --> 01:01:13.829
and leave the politics
to the professionals.

01:01:13.967 --> 01:01:16.348
[Lottie sobbing]

01:01:16.486 --> 01:01:18.937

do it to me again.

RUBY [over phone]: Oh, honey.

01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:21.975
Did you really think you were

01:01:22.113 --> 01:01:23.562
going to heal yourself
by hurting John?

01:01:23.701 --> 01:01:25.288
[Lottie sobbing over phone]

01:01:25.426 --> 01:01:27.290
Just come home, Lottie.

01:01:29.258 --> 01:01:30.880
Just come home.

heard from Lottie?

01:01:37.162 --> 01:01:38.474
PUNDIT [over computer]:
Campaign manager...

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.372
DAVID: All right, if
you can keep trying.

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:41.960
Thanks, Myra.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.548
PUNDIT [over computer]:
It may be safe to assume

01:01:43.686 --> 01:01:45.930
she’s responsible
for both fabricating

01:01:46.068 --> 01:01:48.346
and disseminating
the false allegations

01:01:48.484 --> 01:01:50.072
against Senator Kane.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.659
At the very least,

01:01:51.798 --> 01:01:53.972
- it’s likely she’s been fired.
- [sighs]

01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.054
Pastor Dave?

01:02:07.192 --> 01:02:09.608
Uh, I didn’t think
you’d be here this late.

01:02:12.577 --> 01:02:16.823
City’s gonna condemn the
shelter if we can’t get it up to code.

01:02:16.961 --> 01:02:19.273
Yeah. I saw that.

01:02:20.412 --> 01:02:22.345
[chuckles] It’s been a day.

01:02:23.277 --> 01:02:27.419
I’m sorry, Martin, uh, is there
something I can help you with?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.942
This is very
difficult, Pastor, but...

01:02:35.289 --> 01:02:36.877
It’s from the board.

01:02:44.989 --> 01:02:46.922
They think you
should take a break.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.131
They’re suspending me.

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:50.649
Just until things
are cleared up.

01:02:50.788 --> 01:02:52.168
I know there must be
a misunderstanding.

01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:54.584
I tried to tell
the board, but...

01:02:54.722 --> 01:02:58.554
they said this thing with
you and Senator Kane,

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.383
it looks bad.

01:03:03.455 --> 01:03:05.216
Yeah.

01:03:05.354 --> 01:03:07.011
Okay.

01:03:12.085 --> 01:03:14.708
I’m supposed to
ask you for your keys.

01:03:14.846 --> 01:03:16.330
I’m so sorry.

01:03:34.348 --> 01:03:36.247
Thanks, Martin.

01:03:47.568 --> 01:03:49.777
You ready to go home, Rev?

01:03:49.916 --> 01:03:52.159
Thanks, Tom, but
I’m-I’m gonna walk.

REPORTER [over TV]:
Voters still reeling from

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:08.304
yesterday’s allegations
against Reverend David Hill.

01:05:08.442 --> 01:05:10.617
Shocking behavior from a
member of the community’s

01:05:10.755 --> 01:05:12.515
respected clergy.

01:05:12.653 --> 01:05:14.897
It’s expected he’ll
announce his concession in...

01:05:18.418 --> 01:05:21.145
Where did I go wrong, Lord?

01:05:21.283 --> 01:05:23.285
[doorbell chiming]

01:05:32.363 --> 01:05:34.468
- Daryl?
- [Smith chuckles]

01:05:34.606 --> 01:05:36.298
Reverend.

01:05:42.718 --> 01:05:45.583
I’ve been publicly disgraced.

01:05:45.721 --> 01:05:47.619
I may have to move.

01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:50.243
I could face criminal charges.

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:53.971
Maybe I wasn’t saving the world,
but I was happy being a pastor.

01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:55.800
You know, get the
women’s shelter back open.

01:05:55.938 --> 01:05:57.595
Now I can’t even
do that anymore.

01:05:57.733 --> 01:05:58.872
You finished?

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:02.255
Have you heard a word I said?

01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:03.946
Yes.

01:06:04.084 --> 01:06:05.913
The Lord chased you out
of your comfort zone, and...

01:06:06.052 --> 01:06:07.881
you’re not happy
with where you landed.

01:06:08.019 --> 01:06:09.607
I’m withdrawing from the race.

01:06:09.745 --> 01:06:13.024
Get my life back... if
my life will have me back.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.855
No. Hmm.

01:06:16.994 --> 01:06:19.341
You put your hand to the plow.

01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:20.721
There’s no looking back.

01:06:20.859 --> 01:06:22.551
You know this.

01:06:24.518 --> 01:06:26.348
What’s in the bag?

01:06:30.145 --> 01:06:32.078
[sighs]

01:06:39.154 --> 01:06:40.189
Pine cones?

01:06:40.327 --> 01:06:41.949
Lodgepole pine cones.

They’re covered
in a superhard sap

01:06:45.229 --> 01:06:47.024
to protect the seeds inside.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.199
Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:06:50.337 --> 01:06:54.307
There can be no new growth
until you expose the pine cone.

01:06:55.687 --> 01:07:00.382
The heat, extreme
heat, like fire heat.

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:05.042
So they have to burn?

01:07:06.284 --> 01:07:08.148
That’s the upside of wildfires.

01:07:09.046 --> 01:07:11.703
It’s how old
forests are revived.

01:07:13.705 --> 01:07:15.638
Listen, David.

01:07:16.984 --> 01:07:19.401
There are a lot of folk

01:07:19.539 --> 01:07:22.749
that no matter
what color they vote,

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:25.821
they have lost hope in
the future of our country.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:30.067
I see it every day in the
faces of my constituents.

01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:34.105
Same in my congregation.

01:07:34.243 --> 01:07:35.624
They’re wondering
where they fit in

01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:37.798
or even if they should.

01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:40.146
40 million
Christians don’t vote.

01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:44.357
Then another 15 million
aren’t even registered.

01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:45.841
Well, politics is
a dirty business.

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.601
Yeah, so is taking
out the garbage,

01:07:47.739 --> 01:07:51.260
but if you turn your back
to it, things start to stink.

01:07:51.398 --> 01:07:52.675
[chuckles softly]

01:07:52.813 --> 01:07:54.746
- We can no longer ignore this.
- [sighs]

01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:56.748
We have to push
the good of our faith

01:07:56.886 --> 01:07:58.405
into this political process.

01:07:58.543 --> 01:08:01.270
And it is your campaign
that sets the example

01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:03.479
for Christian involvement
in the civic square.

01:08:03.617 --> 01:08:05.688
- What about nonbelievers?
- What about ’em?

01:08:05.826 --> 01:08:07.034
Things are so bad out there.

01:08:07.173 --> 01:08:08.829
We build it right,
they will come.

01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:12.868
In fact, they will
welcome our engagement.

01:08:14.352 --> 01:08:16.216
I don’t know, Daryl.

01:08:17.769 --> 01:08:21.118
[sighs] It just...

01:08:21.256 --> 01:08:23.982
- seems so...
- Impossible?

01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:28.125
Yeah.

01:08:28.263 --> 01:08:31.542
It’s always impossible...

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.647
until it’s done.

01:08:41.655 --> 01:08:43.485
Until it’s done.

01:08:58.258 --> 01:09:00.709
SAM: I think you’re
making a brave choice.

01:09:00.847 --> 01:09:03.263
Which means you
think I’m being foolish.

01:09:03.401 --> 01:09:05.403
Depends on what you say.

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:08.579
Are you really gonna admit you
knew about the oppo research?

01:09:08.717 --> 01:09:10.167
SAM: Just deny it.

01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:11.754
You have to lie in order
to preserve your image

01:09:11.892 --> 01:09:14.240
- of being honest.
- Did you just hear yourself?

01:09:14.378 --> 01:09:15.931
MYRA: Well, there’s
only one other option.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.416
You are gonna have to
throw Lottie under the bus.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.591
Yeah, I’m not really
loving the choices here.

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.524
I’m gonna be straight with you.

01:09:22.662 --> 01:09:24.767
No matter what you say,
it probably won’t work.

01:09:24.905 --> 01:09:26.528
Your chances of
winning this election

01:09:26.666 --> 01:09:29.255
have gone from
slim to nonexistent.

01:09:29.393 --> 01:09:32.430
We were counting on that
third debate to close the gap.

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.777
There’s no reason for
Wesley to let Kane do that now.

01:09:34.915 --> 01:09:36.952
- I mean, they’ve already won.
- Regardless of what happens,

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.712
there’s one thing
that I’m sure of:

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:40.887
Going forward, we
stop spending money.

01:09:41.025 --> 01:09:43.752
No more ads, no more
posters, no more flyers,

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:45.581
no more social media spends.

01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:46.996
- Come on.
- Nothing.

01:09:47.134 --> 01:09:48.619
Damage control is
very expensive, David.

01:09:48.757 --> 01:09:51.104
Please, not a penny more.

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:53.417
It’s almost time.

01:09:55.936 --> 01:09:58.422
[reporters clamoring,
shouts of "Reverend Hill!"]

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.631
DAVID: Hello. Good afternoon.

01:10:00.769 --> 01:10:02.322
Uh, hi, guys.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.013
DAVID [over tablet]: I, uh...

01:10:04.151 --> 01:10:05.843
I want to thank you
all for coming out

01:10:05.981 --> 01:10:08.259
- on such short notice.
- [sighs, chuckles]

01:10:08.397 --> 01:10:10.641
I also want to extend my
most sincere apologies

01:10:10.779 --> 01:10:12.436
to Senator Kane and his staff.

01:10:12.574 --> 01:10:14.127
I’m not interested
in your apologies.

01:10:14.265 --> 01:10:15.093
DAVID [over tablet]: This
happened on my watch...

01:10:15.232 --> 01:10:16.474
Just withdraw already.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:19.305
...so I take full
responsibility.

01:10:19.443 --> 01:10:21.790
All that is left to
say on the matter is:

01:10:21.928 --> 01:10:24.068
I’ve never been involved
in anything like this before,

01:10:24.206 --> 01:10:26.588
and it’ll never happen again.

01:10:27.554 --> 01:10:29.936
I would add that...

01:10:30.074 --> 01:10:32.490
our political system is broken.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.907
It encourages good
people to do bad things.

01:10:36.045 --> 01:10:38.358
And it’s up to us to fix it,

01:10:38.496 --> 01:10:41.465
{\an8}which is why I’ve decided
to continue my campaign

01:10:41.603 --> 01:10:44.088
{\an8}and drive that message
to the American people.

01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:46.297
He won’t stay dead!

01:10:46.435 --> 01:10:47.885
DAVID [over tablet]: I
would ask that Senator Kane

01:10:48.023 --> 01:10:49.611
honor the terms of
our original agreement

01:10:49.749 --> 01:10:51.475
and meet me for
one final debate.

01:10:51.613 --> 01:10:53.028
- Thank you.
- [reporters clamoring]

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:54.685
REPORTER: Reverend
Hill! Reverend Hill!

01:10:54.823 --> 01:10:56.203
The information
in the press leak,

01:10:56.342 --> 01:10:58.378
did you know it was fabricated?

01:10:58.516 --> 01:10:59.655
Lottie Jay, has she been fired?

01:10:59.793 --> 01:11:02.451
[clamoring continues]

01:11:02.589 --> 01:11:05.005
I would ask that Senator
Kane honor the terms

01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:06.490
- of our original agreement...
- WOMAN: All right.

01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:08.215
Thank you for staying
with us, Miss Jay.

01:11:08.354 --> 01:11:10.252
DAVID: ...and meet me for
one final debate. Thank you.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.289
[reporters clamoring over TV]

01:11:17.121 --> 01:11:19.675
[takes deep breath]

01:11:19.813 --> 01:11:22.644
First to the office, and
then to the airport, Tom.

01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:24.197
TOM: Well, why are you leaving

01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:26.164
when the election’s
not even over yet?

01:11:26.303 --> 01:11:27.821
LOTTIE: Yes, it is.

01:11:27.959 --> 01:11:29.823
TOM: Well, Rev
Dave’s not giving up.

01:11:31.584 --> 01:11:34.690
He should’ve never
run in the first place.

01:11:34.828 --> 01:11:36.830
I’m to blame for that, too.

01:11:40.178 --> 01:11:42.698
Look, all I know is running
away never solved anything.

01:11:42.836 --> 01:11:46.357
It just... it just
makes you tired.

01:11:55.884 --> 01:11:57.575
I almost let you beat me.

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.439
I was this close
until I realized

01:11:59.577 --> 01:12:02.200
you’re not worth my
pride or my self-respect.

01:12:02.339 --> 01:12:04.202
Wesley sent the
Kane story to you.

01:12:04.341 --> 01:12:06.550
He was hedging his bets in
case I didn’t go public with it

01:12:06.688 --> 01:12:08.310
because he knew that you would.

01:12:08.448 --> 01:12:10.416
You weren’t doing your
job, so I had to step in

01:12:10.554 --> 01:12:11.969
and do it for you.

01:12:12.107 --> 01:12:13.798
How was I supposed
to know it was a setup?

01:12:13.936 --> 01:12:15.524
You were used,

01:12:15.662 --> 01:12:18.700
and now a lot of people
will suffer because of it.

01:12:18.838 --> 01:12:21.358
I’m sure your
career will recover.

01:12:21.496 --> 01:12:23.394
I’m not talking about me.

01:12:29.158 --> 01:12:30.746
[sighs]

01:12:30.884 --> 01:12:34.854
It happened on my watch,
so I take full responsibility.

01:12:34.992 --> 01:12:37.028
Looks like his
campaign’s gone sour.

01:12:37.166 --> 01:12:38.513
Man.

01:12:38.651 --> 01:12:39.928
Yeah, the Internet
said he was set up.

01:12:40.066 --> 01:12:41.447
- Mm.
- MICHAEL: Goodness.

01:12:41.585 --> 01:12:43.069
We should probably
pray for David, guys.

01:12:43.207 --> 01:12:44.898
Let’s do it.

01:12:45.036 --> 01:12:47.487
God, we pray right now,
Lord, for our brother David

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:50.628
as he stands in the gap
with so many others, Lord.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.630
You bless him, Lord.
Give him success.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:56.565
Let the results be Your
results, God, and Your will, Lord.

01:12:56.703 --> 01:12:58.222
You would turn this
thing around, God.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.086
What Satan meant for evil,

01:13:00.224 --> 01:13:01.984
You would make good,
You would turn to good.

01:13:02.122 --> 01:13:04.780
But we pray, Jesus,
in your name. Amen.

01:13:04.918 --> 01:13:06.437
- ALL: Amen.
- DAVID: ...and honor the terms

01:13:06.575 --> 01:13:08.059
of our original
agreement and meet me

01:13:08.197 --> 01:13:09.923
for one final debate.

01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:11.856
That’s all. Thank you so
much. Appreciate you guys.

01:13:11.994 --> 01:13:13.410
I will ask that Senator Kane

01:13:13.548 --> 01:13:15.619
honor the terms of
our original agreement

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:17.483
and meet me for
one final debate.

01:13:17.621 --> 01:13:19.485
Hill drawing a line in the sand.

01:13:19.623 --> 01:13:22.177
We’ll see how Kane responds.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:25.007
I’ll appear weak if
I don’t debate him.

01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:28.079
You’ll appear
confident, unconcerned.

01:13:28.217 --> 01:13:29.943
This is and always has
been your race to lose.

01:13:30.081 --> 01:13:31.289
You don’t understand.

01:13:31.428 --> 01:13:33.499
These people
humiliated me in court.

01:13:33.637 --> 01:13:35.570
I want to make an
example out of him.

01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:37.088
Do you want victory or revenge?

01:13:37.226 --> 01:13:38.987
- I want both!
- It’s too risky.

01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:40.678
Remember, I call the shots here.

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:41.886
You work for me.

01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:43.612
Make it happen.

01:13:47.789 --> 01:13:49.791
[sighs]

01:13:53.691 --> 01:13:55.175
[sighs]

01:13:59.386 --> 01:14:01.216
LOTTIE: Don’t use a vacuum.

01:14:03.529 --> 01:14:05.807
Lottie.

01:14:05.945 --> 01:14:07.705
I’ve been looking for you.

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.259
I’m guilty of many
despicable things.

01:14:10.397 --> 01:14:13.331
Betraying you wasn’t one of ’em.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.334
Marc sent the bogus
intel to the press.

01:14:17.301 --> 01:14:19.268
Kind of figured that.

01:14:21.616 --> 01:14:23.480
You should use a
damp paper towel

01:14:23.618 --> 01:14:25.827
to clean up the coffee.

01:14:25.965 --> 01:14:27.553
You sure?

01:14:27.691 --> 01:14:29.658
Pretty sure.

01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:34.007
- DAVID: Ah.
- [both laughing]

01:14:45.363 --> 01:14:46.986
LOTTIE: Thanks.

01:14:48.815 --> 01:14:50.714
[David sighs]

01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:05.107
[David sighs]

01:15:08.559 --> 01:15:11.597
When I told John
I was pregnant...

01:15:13.115 --> 01:15:14.910
...he told me to...

01:15:15.048 --> 01:15:16.947
"take care of it."

01:15:20.329 --> 01:15:22.193
And so I did.

01:15:23.712 --> 01:15:26.922
I’ve been taking care of our
son Christopher ever since.

01:15:32.549 --> 01:15:35.241
Spent years...

01:15:35.379 --> 01:15:39.694
feeling robbed and unworthy.

01:15:44.871 --> 01:15:47.356
I let those feelings define me.

01:15:51.222 --> 01:15:54.432
I didn’t come here to
help you win an election.

01:15:57.884 --> 01:16:00.611
I came to hurt the
person that hurt me.

01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:08.930
Letting go is the
sweetest revenge.

01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:16.178
I am so sorry that I
dragged you into this.

01:16:22.322 --> 01:16:26.326
I didn’t run because you
or Daryl talked me into it.

01:16:27.465 --> 01:16:29.709
I believe God asked me to.

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.473
How do you know it’s God?

01:16:36.474 --> 01:16:39.995
Well, you know
someone long enough,

01:16:40.133 --> 01:16:42.446
you begin to
recognize His voice.

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:45.794
But sometimes knowing it’s God

01:16:45.932 --> 01:16:48.486
is easier than actually
listening to Him.

01:16:50.765 --> 01:16:54.182
Well, why wouldn’t you listen
to God if you knew it was Him?

01:16:55.804 --> 01:16:57.461
I know, right?

01:16:57.599 --> 01:16:59.739
[Lottie chuckles softly]

01:16:59.877 --> 01:17:03.156
For most folks, it’s fear--

01:17:03.294 --> 01:17:07.471
afraid to fail, afraid
to take a chance.

01:17:09.991 --> 01:17:13.235
But sooner or later, we
all get hit by that storm.

01:17:15.168 --> 01:17:16.722
Hits us at the
worst possible time,

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:20.208
when we’re already
far out and lost at sea.

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:25.247
Our first thought
is stay in the boat,

01:17:25.385 --> 01:17:27.974
even though it’s sinking.

01:17:28.112 --> 01:17:30.805
Doesn’t make any
sense, but we hang on

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:32.841
because it’s what we know.

01:17:34.222 --> 01:17:37.052
And what’s out
there is terrifying.

01:17:39.745 --> 01:17:43.196
But then Jesus walks
across the water,

01:17:43.334 --> 01:17:46.061
then He reaches out His hand

01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:50.410
and He says, "Do not be afraid.

01:17:52.619 --> 01:17:54.311
"Come.

01:17:55.899 --> 01:17:57.694
Get out of the boat."

01:18:00.731 --> 01:18:05.840
Because, well, we know
that... that if we stay in the boat,

01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:10.707
we’ll die and only our
hope in Him can save us.

01:18:14.193 --> 01:18:16.264
God is good, Lottie.

01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:20.199
All the time.

01:18:26.584 --> 01:18:28.448
I’ll call Myra.

01:18:31.935 --> 01:18:36.284
[laughing]: You are gonna
lose this election spectacularly.

01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:42.739
Well, that’s all
the more reason.

01:18:42.877 --> 01:18:44.602
Reason for what?

01:18:45.431 --> 01:18:47.088
To get out of the boat.

01:18:47.226 --> 01:18:49.124
[Lottie chuckles]

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:53.819
DAVID: This coffee is terrible.

01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:56.235
- LOTTIE: The worst.
- [both laughing]

01:19:23.849 --> 01:19:25.782
{\an8}Good evening. I’m Ron Franklin.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.198
{\an8}Welcome to this
congressional debate.

01:19:28.336 --> 01:19:32.616
{\an8}This contest is not just
pivotal to our own community

01:19:32.754 --> 01:19:34.825
{\an8}but has far-reaching
significance

01:19:34.963 --> 01:19:36.931
{\an8}for the entire nation.

01:19:37.069 --> 01:19:38.484
{\an8}We’re not just choosing

01:19:38.622 --> 01:19:40.382
{\an8}- a representative.
- [David praying quietly]

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.316
{\an8}We are selecting the
shape of our country.

01:19:43.454 --> 01:19:45.387
{\an8}DAVID: "He will give you
the desires of your heart."

01:19:45.525 --> 01:19:46.803
{\an8}FRANKLIN: Now,
before we begin...

01:19:46.941 --> 01:19:50.289
{\an8}"Commit your way unto the Lord;

01:19:50.427 --> 01:19:52.843
{\an8}"trust also in Him,

01:19:52.981 --> 01:19:55.432
{\an8}and He will bring it to pass."

01:19:56.813 --> 01:19:59.539
{\an8}You praying for a
miracle, Reverend?

01:20:01.127 --> 01:20:03.405
{\an8}- Are you saying you want one?
- [chuckles]

01:20:04.337 --> 01:20:07.409
{\an8}Oh, I’ve seen the numbers.

01:20:07.547 --> 01:20:09.618
{\an8}You’ve seen the numbers.

01:20:09.756 --> 01:20:12.345
{\an8}I’m not the one that
needs divine intervention.

01:20:12.483 --> 01:20:13.760
{\an8}[laughs]

01:20:16.315 --> 01:20:19.421
{\an8}I see someone else
behind that arrogant facade.

01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:23.425
{\an8}I see a man who’s lost his way.

01:20:23.563 --> 01:20:25.703
{\an8}Someone who’s forgotten
what it’s like to lead

01:20:25.842 --> 01:20:27.844
{\an8}with integrity and compassion.

01:20:30.329 --> 01:20:33.746
{\an8}As a matter of fact, I came
here to offer you a lifeline.

01:20:33.884 --> 01:20:37.508
{\an8}All right? A way out.

01:20:37.646 --> 01:20:39.545
{\an8}You concede the race now,

01:20:39.683 --> 01:20:42.065
{\an8}and I’ll return everything
you’ve sacrificed.

01:20:42.203 --> 01:20:43.894
{\an8}I’ll arrange for the
women’s center

01:20:44.032 --> 01:20:45.620
{\an8}to get the funding
that it needs.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.518
{\an8}I’ll tell the press
that you’re innocent

01:20:47.656 --> 01:20:51.695
{\an8}of spreading those nasty lies
about my life in public service.

01:20:52.489 --> 01:20:56.527
{\an8}You can salvage your
reputation, and who knows,

01:20:56.665 --> 01:20:58.909
{\an8}you may even get your job back.

01:20:59.047 --> 01:21:01.222
{\an8}[gasps, chuckles]

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.571
{\an8}Surrender now, and no
one else has to get hurt.

01:21:06.399 --> 01:21:08.298
{\an8}DAVID: What about the voters?

01:21:08.436 --> 01:21:10.334
{\an8}They’ll get hurt.

01:21:10.472 --> 01:21:13.234
{\an8}See, this is the part
where you behave

01:21:13.372 --> 01:21:17.617
{\an8}like a good Christian
and turn the other cheek.

01:21:18.929 --> 01:21:22.243
{\an8}Your nation’s counting
on you, Reverend.

01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:24.072
{\an8}[chuckles]

01:21:31.597 --> 01:21:33.116
{\an8}What was that about?

01:21:37.706 --> 01:21:39.708
{\an8}[applause]

01:21:40.571 --> 01:21:43.505
{\an8}FRANKLIN: Now I’d like to
introduce tonight’s candidates.

01:21:43.643 --> 01:21:46.474
Would you welcome
State Senator Peter Kane

01:21:46.612 --> 01:21:48.683
and Reverend David Hill.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:52.445
- [cheering and applause]
- [cameras clicking]

01:21:57.381 --> 01:21:59.280
- Thank you very much.
- State Senator.

01:21:59.418 --> 01:22:00.902
- Thank you.
- Reverend, great to see you.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.800
Have a great debate.

01:22:02.939 --> 01:22:04.630
KANE: Are you going to deny

01:22:04.768 --> 01:22:07.322
that your loyalties to
the country are likely

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.325
to be compromised by your
allegiance to the church?

01:22:10.463 --> 01:22:11.809
DAVID: That’s just
not true, Senator.

01:22:11.948 --> 01:22:13.501
KANE: Well, it
says it right there

01:22:13.639 --> 01:22:16.124
in your book right there:

01:22:16.262 --> 01:22:18.955
"You cannot serve two masters."

01:22:19.093 --> 01:22:21.543
[applause]

01:22:21.681 --> 01:22:24.650
The church is subject
only to the Word of God.

01:22:24.788 --> 01:22:27.618
And believe me, you don’t want
to remove that from government.

01:22:27.756 --> 01:22:29.379
[scattered applause]

01:22:29.517 --> 01:22:31.381
You guys remember
how upset you were

01:22:31.519 --> 01:22:33.693
when they eliminated
prayer in school?

01:22:34.487 --> 01:22:36.662
[over TV]: That’s nothing to
what our nation would become

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.388
if we allow them to eliminate

01:22:38.526 --> 01:22:40.286
religious freedoms
and Christianity.

01:22:40.424 --> 01:22:42.047
Oh, you’re playing
the God card here now.

01:22:42.185 --> 01:22:43.186
- Think China, North Korea.
- Maybe you haven’t heard,

01:22:43.324 --> 01:22:45.050
God is not on the ballot.

01:22:45.188 --> 01:22:46.879
- European socialist countries.
- Do you hear yourself now?

01:22:47.017 --> 01:22:48.501
I do, and so could everyone else

01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:50.365
- if you’d stop interrupting.
- [applause]

01:22:50.503 --> 01:22:52.022
FRANKLIN [over TV]: Uh, a
word of caution to our audience.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.541
Kane knows all the tricks.

01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:55.370
He’s never gonna
let Hill off the ropes.

01:22:55.508 --> 01:22:57.062
FRANKLIN [over TV]: ...keep
your reactions to a minimum.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.511
KANE: You call it interference.

01:22:58.649 --> 01:23:00.306
I call it a caring government

01:23:00.444 --> 01:23:01.825
- that provides for its citizens.
- [applause]

01:23:01.963 --> 01:23:03.413
After all, "Do unto others."

01:23:03.551 --> 01:23:05.863
Isn’t that the main
message of Christianity?

01:23:06.002 --> 01:23:07.313
Hmm? Is it not?

01:23:07.451 --> 01:23:09.039
No.

01:23:09.177 --> 01:23:10.661
KANE: And isn’t "love
thy neighbor" central

01:23:10.799 --> 01:23:11.938
to the teachings of Jesus?

01:23:12.077 --> 01:23:13.423
No, Senator.

01:23:13.561 --> 01:23:17.427
Central to the teachings
of Jesus is Jesus.

01:23:17.565 --> 01:23:18.704
[applause, murmurs of agreement]

01:23:18.842 --> 01:23:20.602
Why is it every four years

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.605
we have to watch a politician
take Jesus off their shelf,

01:23:23.743 --> 01:23:25.745
find a Bible verse
that they found

01:23:25.883 --> 01:23:27.402
on someone else’s Instagram page

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.266
and use just a piece of it

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:32.649
in order to advance
their political agenda?

01:23:32.787 --> 01:23:35.065
- [applause, murmuring]
- Senator, you seem to miss

01:23:35.203 --> 01:23:37.378
- the one key and vital point.
- No, no, no. You miss the point.

01:23:37.516 --> 01:23:38.931
The point, uh, today...

01:23:39.069 --> 01:23:41.382
The only reason
Jesus’s teachings

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.935
of "love thy neighbor" resonates

01:23:43.073 --> 01:23:44.695
is because He
was the Son of God,

01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:46.594
the Creator of the universe.

01:23:46.732 --> 01:23:48.389
- [applause]
- Without that minor detail,

01:23:48.527 --> 01:23:50.529
Jesus would just be
another false prophet.

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:52.634
- Well...
- What you’re trying to do

01:23:52.772 --> 01:23:55.085
is remove God from our schools,

01:23:55.223 --> 01:23:58.985
our culture, our government
and even our history.

01:23:59.124 --> 01:24:01.126
Pastor, you’re laboring
under the misconception

01:24:01.264 --> 01:24:02.782
that our country was
founded based solely

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.233
on Christian principles.

01:24:05.371 --> 01:24:07.304
But let’s not
rewrite history here.

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:09.203
- Our founders...
- [feedback squeals]

01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:11.308
they were a diverse group.

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:15.347
Some were deists,
yes, but others,

01:24:15.485 --> 01:24:20.076
they valued a clear
separation of church and state.

01:24:21.042 --> 01:24:24.425
And these men... these men,

01:24:24.563 --> 01:24:29.361
they gave us America’s
crowning achievement:

01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:31.535
universal human rights.

01:24:31.673 --> 01:24:34.331
A simple yet radical
idea for its time.

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:35.815
MARTIN: They called it

01:24:35.953 --> 01:24:37.369
the Cultural Revolution.

01:24:37.507 --> 01:24:41.959
An idea that was expressed...

01:24:42.098 --> 01:24:43.789
SMITH: They have lost hope

01:24:43.927 --> 01:24:45.998
in the future of
our country. I see it

01:24:46.136 --> 01:24:48.518
every day in the faces
of my constituents.

01:24:48.656 --> 01:24:50.692
KANE: ...succinctly expressed...

01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:53.764
Well, why wouldn’t you listen
to God if you knew it was Him?

01:24:53.902 --> 01:24:55.835
KANE: ...in our
founding documents.

01:24:56.664 --> 01:25:00.978
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident."

01:25:01.945 --> 01:25:03.291
[whispers]: Get out of the boat.

01:25:10.816 --> 01:25:12.645
Finish it.

01:25:13.853 --> 01:25:15.855
Excuse me?

01:25:15.993 --> 01:25:17.961
Finish it.

01:25:18.099 --> 01:25:20.170
What comes next?

01:25:20.308 --> 01:25:21.723
Or do you plan to rewrite

01:25:21.861 --> 01:25:23.794
the Declaration of
Independence, too?

01:25:23.932 --> 01:25:25.624
[laughter]

01:25:25.762 --> 01:25:27.143
[chuckles]

01:25:27.936 --> 01:25:28.903
Ridiculous.

01:25:30.387 --> 01:25:33.183
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,

01:25:33.321 --> 01:25:35.668
"that all men are created equal,

01:25:35.806 --> 01:25:38.913
"that they are endowed
by their Creator

01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:42.434
with certain
inalienable rights."

01:25:42.572 --> 01:25:44.056
Don’t you see, Senator?

01:25:44.194 --> 01:25:47.163
These... these rights--
how did you put it?

01:25:47.301 --> 01:25:49.786
America’s crowning achievement.

01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.202
[cameras clicking]

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:55.171
They don’t come
from a piece of paper.

01:25:55.309 --> 01:25:57.449
They come from God

01:25:57.587 --> 01:26:01.591
and the biblical idea that all
men are created in His image.

01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:03.662
- [applause, cheering]
- Okay... [mutters]

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.081
DAVID [over TV]: We cannot
remove God from the fabric

01:26:09.219 --> 01:26:11.739
of our country without
risk of it collapsing.

01:26:13.016 --> 01:26:16.709
Imagine if all Christians
mobilized and voted.

01:26:16.847 --> 01:26:19.367
Do you know what would happen?

01:26:19.505 --> 01:26:20.955
Ask him.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:24.407
He does, and it terrifies him.

01:26:25.787 --> 01:26:29.239
You have the power
to change things.

01:26:29.377 --> 01:26:31.828
Not me, not him.

01:26:31.966 --> 01:26:34.140
- You.
- [applause]

01:26:36.557 --> 01:26:38.455
So send the message
to Washington.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:41.596
Tell them that you’re not
ready to give that power up.

01:26:43.805 --> 01:26:46.912
Don’t stay quiet.
Don’t be silent.

01:26:47.050 --> 01:26:49.466
Don’t let them push
you into the shadows.

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.917
You are the salt.
You are the light.

01:26:52.055 --> 01:26:54.230
[cheering]

01:26:54.368 --> 01:26:57.888
Fight the good fight.
Fight the good fight.

01:26:58.026 --> 01:27:00.650
[excited laughter, cheering]

01:27:00.788 --> 01:27:01.961
Yeah. Yeah.

01:27:02.099 --> 01:27:03.342
What’s going on?

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:11.247
God gave you a voice.

01:27:11.385 --> 01:27:13.456
He gave you a vote.

01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:16.252
A vote.

01:27:17.805 --> 01:27:18.806
Use it.

01:27:18.944 --> 01:27:21.084
[cheering and applause]

REPORTER: We’re getting
late into the evening now

01:28:38.679 --> 01:28:41.302
as many mail-in ballots
are still being counted.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.305
This race is neck and
neck, owing largely

01:28:44.443 --> 01:28:46.549
to the groundswell after
Sunday night’s debate.

01:28:46.687 --> 01:28:49.931
After a series of
unprecedented recounts,

01:28:50.069 --> 01:28:52.002
this is sure to come
down to the wire,

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:55.351
and we may not have a
final result until the morning.

Thank you.

01:30:03.246 --> 01:30:04.834
Let’s open up our Bibles

01:30:04.972 --> 01:30:07.630
to Psalm 20, verse
six through nine.

01:30:09.217 --> 01:30:12.980
{\an8}"Now this I know:
The Lord gives victory

01:30:13.118 --> 01:30:15.223
{\an8}"to His anointed.

01:30:17.433 --> 01:30:20.263
"He answers him from
His heavenly sanctuary

01:30:20.401 --> 01:30:24.440
"with the victorious
power of His right hand.

"Some trust in chariots
and some in horses,

"but we trust in the
name of the Lord our God.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:37.176
"They are brought
to their knees and fall,

01:30:37.314 --> 01:30:41.836

Marc Shelley.

01:30:52.191 --> 01:30:55.056
Turns out the law allows
you to spend campaign money

01:30:55.194 --> 01:30:56.299
on things like the
women’s center.

01:30:56.437 --> 01:30:57.783
Mm.

MONICA: I don’t know, I just...

01:31:02.961 --> 01:31:05.550
