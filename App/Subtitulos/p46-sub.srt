position of agnosticism.

151
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,798
"Gnostic," from the
Greek "gnosos," to know,

152
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,945
and again, with the prefix
"a" meaning to not know,

153
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:42,974

the existence of a supreme being.

<i>but rather that he never
existed in the first place,</i>

176
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,283
<i>other than in the depths of
our forebears' imaginations.</i>

177
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,221
He was a useful fairy
tale in ages gone by,

178
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,291
when his fiery anger was
used to explain away plagues

179
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,420
and crop failures,
diseases and disasters,

180
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,931
which we now ascribe
to bacteria and viruses,

181
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,844
chromosomal disorders,
and plate tectonics.

182
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:21,239
In short, science and reason
have supplanted superstition,

183
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,242
and we are all
the better for it.

184
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,944
And with your permission,

185
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,825
<i>I would like to bypass this
senseless debate all together</i>

186
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,049
<i>and jump to the conclusion</i>

187
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,428
of which every sophomore
is already aware of:

188
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,919
there is no God.

189
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,222
<i>All that I require
from each of you</i>

190
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,510
<i>is that you fill in the
papers I've just given you</i>

191
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,829
with three little
words: "God is dead,"

192
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,330
along with your signature.

193
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,244
The sooner we reach a
unanimous consensus,

194
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,801
which I expect we will,

195
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,070
I will be spared
the tedious duty

196
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,016
of slogging through dry
and dusty arguments,

197
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,307
and you will bypass
the section of the course

198
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,396
in which students have
traditionally received

199
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:04,115
their lowest grades
of the semester.

200
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:09,420
<i>And when you finish, please
pass your papers to the right.</i>

201
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,905
<i>Thank you.</i>

202
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,353
<i>Thank you.</i>

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,958
Oh, a lower case "g."

204
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,461
Maybe this one ought
to get extra credit.

205
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,865
Thank you.

206
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,503
Excuse me, Mister...

207
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,241
Wheaton. Josh Wheaton.

208
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,845
Mr. Wheaton, is something wrong?

209
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,847
Yeah, I can't.

210
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,492
I can't do what you want.

211
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,050
I'm a Christian.

212
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,551
Oh, don't worry.

213
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
You can still go back
to your dorm room

214
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,121
and sink to your knees

215
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,810
<i>and pray to your
bedside if you'd like.</i>

216
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,970
<i>What you do in your
personal life is your business,</i>

217
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,127
but what you do
in this class is mine.

218
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,996
I can't.

219
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,501
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

220
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,105
Allow me to explain
the alternative.

221
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,540
<i>If you cannot bring yourself
to admit that God is dead</i>

222
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,243
for the purposes of this class,

223
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,945
then you will need to
defend the antithesis

224
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,446
that God is not dead.

225
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,615
And you'll need to do
it in front of this class

226
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,018
from the podium.

227
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:51,589
<i>And if you fail, as you
shall, you will fail this section</i>

228
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,558
and lose 30% of your
final grade right off the bat.

229
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,661
Are you ready to accept that?

230
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,508
Well, who would
decide whether I won

231
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,499
or lost the argument?

232
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,268
Well, I would.

233
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,003
It's my class, my rules.

234
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,537
Grading's my prerogative.

235
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:12,110
No disrespect, but I'm not
sure you can be objective.

236
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,545
What would you propose?

237
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:21,019
Well, what about them?

238
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,520
Well, that's interesting,

239
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,290
but why would I want
to empower them?

240
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,136
Well, you've already
won them over.

241
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,205
I mean, I'd have
to unconvince them,

242
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:33,531
get them to admit
they were wrong.

243
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:42,173
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

244
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,674
<i>You'll get 3 sessions,</i>

245
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,644
the last 20 minutes of
each of the next 3 classes,

246
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,948
to make your case.

247
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:54,185
<i>I promise to keep my
interruptions to a minimum.</i>

248
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,565
You may take whatever
questions you'd like from the class,

249
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,157
but I will not increase
your allotted time.

250
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,037
<i>Of course, you'll be responsible</i>

251
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,361
<i>for all the other
class assignments.</i>

252
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,369
But, you know, you
could change your mind

253
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,299
and bring in your signed
statement at our next class,

254
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:14,172
and we'll go forward as though
none of this ever happened.

255
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:18,209
The rest of us, having dispensed
with primitive superstition,

256
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,279
will turn our focus to the
issue of being in reality.

257
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,314
For our next class,

258
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,184
please have read David Hume's
"The Problems of Induction"

259
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:30,688
and Renee Descartes'
"Discourse on Method,"

260
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:34,025
to which you may
add Bertrand Russell's

261
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,094
"Why I Am Not a Christian"

262
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:40,398
in preparation for
Mr. Wheaton's lecture

263
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,235
<i>and in thanks for his
failure to help us reach</i>

264
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,538
a unanimous consensus.

265
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,298
<i>You don't want to
deny your faith, I get it.</i>

266
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,522
<i>So, the answer's
simple: drop the class.</i>

267
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,425
Yeah, but I'm not
sure I can do that.

268
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:11,262
I feel like God wants
someone to defend him.

269
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,298
Don't be ridiculous.

270
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,846
I don't know, I
just keep thinking

271
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,737
of that C.S. Lewis line,

272
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:24,375
<i>"Only a real risk can
test the reality of a belief."</i>

273
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,323
<i>So, you're gonna risk our
future over your yearbook quote?</i>

274
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,648
<i>Josh, why am I here?</i>

275
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,351
Hello, earth to Josh.

276
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,753
<i>Why am I, Salutatorian
of our graduating class,</i>

277
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,755
here at my third-choice school?

278
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,601
I'm sorry for having
the next 50 years

279
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,159
of our life planned out.

280
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,660
That's just who I am.

281
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,068
I don't know, Kara, it's just...

282
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,609
<i>Josh, I love you, but
I absolutely forbid you</i>

283
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,111
to go up against this
professor in his own classroom.

284
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,301
We have too much at stake.

285
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,315
The whole thing's rigged to
make you look like an idiot,

286
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,859
<i>and if you want to
get into law school,</i>

287
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,519
<i>you can't afford
to flunk this class.</i>

288
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,043
Even a "C" could be disastrous.

289
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:10,915
♪♪♪

290
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,760
I don't know why
you wear those heels.

291
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,463
What's wrong with 'em?

292
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,164
You're too tall.
You're taller than me.

293
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,733
You're man enough to handle it.

294
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,646
I'm just saying, I don't want
to be the short guy at the prom.

295
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,204
Mr. Robertson!

296
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,883
Hi, or should I call you Willie?

297
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,440
You can call me Willie.

298
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,420
Amy Ryan, I blog "The New Left."

299
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,921
Can I ask you a few questions?

300
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,545
Yeah, sure, fire
away. This is my wife...

301
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,292
<i>Korie, I know.</i>

302
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,294
I'm actually surprised
to see you here.

303
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:44,255
I thought you'd be home,
barefoot and pregnant.

304
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,191
I haven't been barefoot and
pregnant in a really long time.

305
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,837
<i>I do kinda miss those days, huh?</i>

306
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,561
Yeah, you want to
start again? We can try.

307
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,296
No.

308
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,843
<i>You've made a
fortune selling devices</i>

309
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,246
that are designed to lure
water fowl to their deaths.

310
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,137
Oh, I guess when you say "you,"

311
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,839
you're referring to the
whole group of my family,

312
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,574
which would be "y'all."

313
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,343
You can just
change it to "y'all."

314
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,844
That'd be an easier expression,

315
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,690
that way it'll get
everybody in there.

316
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,726
So, y'all have made a
fortune, isn't that right?

317
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,283
We're doing alright.

318
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,785
We can certainly buy
bigger tires on our trucks

319
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,714
and four-wheelers to
get out in the mud with,

320
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,389
so life is good.

321
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,402
What makes you think
you have the moral right

322
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,427
to go around maiming and
killing innocent animals?

323
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,530
Hey, look, let's just
get one thing straight.

324
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,265
I ain't maiming nothing.

325
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,634
Whatever I see
and I aim at, I shoot.

326
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,336
When I shoot it, I
kill it and then I eat it.

327
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,982
So, you do kill those ducks?

328
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,873
<i>Of course I do.
What am I gonna do,</i>

329
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,719
cook 'em while they're
still moving around?

330
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,277
That would be cruel.

331
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,085
<i>That'd be bad.</i>

332
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,460
So, this isn't an act? You're
actually proud of what you do?

333
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,495
Of course I am. Why would
I do it if I'm not proud of it?

334
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,996
And you go along with
everything he says?

335
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,698
We've been married for 20 years.

336
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,642
I don't go along with
everything he says,

337
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,857
but on the things
that matter, yeah,

338
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,959
I agree wholeheartedly.

339
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,463
So, what do you say to people
who are offended by your show,

340
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,377
not just because of the hunting,

341
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,569
but because you openly pray
to Jesus in every episode?

342
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,338
Hey, we're not trying to
offend anybody, alright?

343
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,985
<i>If they don't want to watch the
show, they can turn the channel.</i>

344
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,609
As far as my praying to Jesus,

345
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,912
my life and my whole
eternity belongs to God.

346

the money, fame, success.

Jesus, that's eternal.

350
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,724
Jesus said this:

351
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,826
<i>"Whoever acknowledges
me before men,"</i>

352
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,662
he will acknowledge
before the Father in heaven.

353
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:35,499
<i>"Whoever disowns me, I'll
disown him to the Father."</i>

354
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,336

The decisions you make now
can have real consequences.

523
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,642
Josh!

524
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,344
<i>Josh, this is serious.</i>

525
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,146
I know.

526
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,315
You know.

527
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,699
<i>I can't believe I'm making
a 12-hour drive to Florida</i>

528
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,426
<i>to do things that seemed
corny when I was 12.</i>

529
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:46,363
<i>David, I promised my mother
a picture of me in mouse ears</i>

530
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,366
standing in front of
the fairy tale castle.

531
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,202
The mouse ears are
for me, picture is for her.

532
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:57,140
To you, it's old-hat, but to me,
it's a lifelong dream come true.

533
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,176
Can you not understand that?

534
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,113
Then we'll go for the
undersea submarine ride.

535
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:06,227
<i>Actually, I think they closed
that ride like 20 years ago.</i>

536
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,751
And then we'll ride the
world's biggest roller coaster.

537
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,620
Sixteenth biggest.

538
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,623
In my mind, when I'm
screaming as we descend,

539
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,558
it will be the world's biggest

540
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,462
and I'll be glad that
it's not taller than it is.

541
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,270
That doesn't sound good.

542
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,174
Maybe the battery...

543
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,478
Or the starter.

544
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,547
Either way, we're not
going anywhere right now.

545
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,663
I'll call and arrange
for a rental car.

546
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,587
But how will we
get to the rental car?

547
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,289
They'll deliver it to us.

548
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,790
Are you serious?

549
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,493
Yeah, absolutely.

550
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,361
They'll deliver us the
car we are to drive?

551
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,063
Yeah.

552
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,564
Hello?

553
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,266
Amazing.

554
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,280
<i>But there are some
flat-earthers out there</i>

555
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,182
<i>who still consider the
existence of a supreme deity</i>

556
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,341
to be either necessary,
or self-evident, or both.

557
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,609
And with that, as
previously announced,

558
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,047
I will be turning the
podium over to Mr. Wheaton,

559
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,759
<i>who will be presenting
his case in favor</i>

560
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,518
<i>of a supreme celestial dictator,</i>

561
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:18,055
<i>otherwise known as God.</i>

562
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:23,060
Mr. Wheaton, are you ready?

563
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,562
Podium is yours.

564
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:58,095
Atheists say that no one can
prove the existence of God,

565
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,398
and well, they're right.

566
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:06,536
<i>But I say no one can
disprove that God exists.</i>

567
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:14,444
<i>But the only way
to debate this issue</i>

568
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,291
<i>is to look at the
available evidence,</i>

569
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:18,195
and that's what
we're going to do.

570
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,452
We're going to put God on trial,

571
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,155
with Professor Radisson
as the prosecutor,

572
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,889
and me as the defense attorney,

573
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:31,861
and you as the jury.

574
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,796
Most cosmologists now agree

575
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,367
that the universe began
some 13.7 billion years ago

576
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,836
<i>in an event known
as the Big Bang.</i>

577
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,439
<i>So, let's look at
theoretical physicist</i>

578
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,609
<i>and Nobel Prize winner
Steven Weinberg's description</i>

579
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,817
of what the Big Bang
would have looked like.

580
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,780
And since he's an atheist,

581
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,883
we can be sure there
isn't any believer-bias

582
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,619
in his description.

583
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,698
<i>In the beginning,
there was an explosion,</i>

584
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,624
<i>and in 3 minutes, 98%
of the matter there is</i>

585
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,892
<i>or ever will be, was produced.</i>

586
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,395
<i>We had a universe.</i>

587
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:06,896
<i>For 2,500 years,</i>

588
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,499
most scientists agreed
with Aristotle on the idea

589
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,268
of a steady-state universe,

590
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,836
<i>that the universe
has always existed</i>

591
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,706
with no beginning and no
end, but the Bible disagreed.

592
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:20,343
<i>In the 1920s, Belgian astronomer
Georges Lemaître, a theist,</i>

593
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,844
who was actually also...

594
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,824
<i>What's a theist?</i>

595
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,750
<i>A theist is someone who
believes in the existence of God.</i>

596
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,488
<i>He said that the entire
universe jumping into existence</i>

597
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,391
in a trillionth of a
trillionth of a second,

598
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,925
out of nothingness,

599
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,961
in an unimaginably
intense flash of light

600
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,631
is how he would expect
the universe to respond

601
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,735
if God were to actually utter
the command in Genesis 1:3,

602
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:49,339
"Let there be light."

603
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,819
<i>In other words, the origin
of the universe unfolded</i>

604
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,277
<i>exactly how one would
expect after reading Genesis,</i>

605
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,946
and for 2,500 years,

606
00:36:57,316 --> 00:37:04,287
the Bible had it right
and science had it wrong.

607
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,990
<i>So, the earliest you
can get here is 5?</i>

608
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,860
Okay, we'll be waiting.

609
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:14,297
Wait, it has air
conditioning, right?

610
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,433
Okay, thanks.

611
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,571
<i>Well, looks like we won't
get there 'til late tonight.</i>

612
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,007
Sorry, I think you're gonna
miss an entire day at the park.

613
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:26,710
It's okay, David.

614
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,479
I'm sure we can make good
use of our time here today.

615
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,013
Sure.

616
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,749
<i>We can meet the choir director,</i>

617
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,652
talk about song choices
for the upcoming concert.

618
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,655
Or we could meet
the women's club

619
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,625
<i>about the details for
the next craft bazaar.</i>

620
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,393
Lots of important stuff.

621
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,306
<i>And since you're not leaving,</i>

622
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,297
you'll have time to
meet Mina for lunch.

623
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,899
Right, I can meet
Mina for lunch.

624
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,580
<i>Sounds like you need this
vacation more than I do.</i>

625
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,872
<i>No, I just need to do
some meaningful work</i>

626
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,875
so that I can have something
to take a vacation from.

627
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,723
<i>You know, some of the most
important work that we do</i>

628
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,313
may seem meaningless to us.

629
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,847
This coming from the missionary

630
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,650
who literally is
in the trenches,

631
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,051
winning hearts for the
Lord on a daily basis.

632
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,855
David, God has you
exactly where he wants you.

633
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,725
<i>He who is faithful
in a very little thing</i>

634
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,927
is also faithful in much.

635
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,040
God knows you're doing the work.

636
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,766
It's all part of
his grand design.

637
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,112
<i>All of which points to
a God that created it.</i>

638
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,438
You see, in the real
world, we never see things

639
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,740
jumping into existence
out of nothingness,

640
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:35,545
but atheists want to make
one small exception to this rule,

641
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:37,592
namely, the universe
and everything in it.

642
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:39,661
<i>But in his book,
"The God Delusion,"</i>

643
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,017
Richard Dawkins says

644
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,466
that, "If you tell me God
created the universe,

645
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:49,326
then I have the right to
ask you who created God."

646
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,374
Dawkins' question
only makes sense

647
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,963
in terms of a God
who has been created.

648
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,700
It doesn't make sense in
terms of an uncreated God,

649
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,046
which is the kind of God
that Christians believe in.

650
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,748
And even leaving
God out of the equation,

651
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,917
I then have a right to turn
Mr. Dawkins's own question

652
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,074
back around on him and ask,

653
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,646
<i>"If the universe created you,
then who created the universe?"</i>

654
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,450
You see, both the theist and
the atheist are both burdened

655
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,458
with answering
this same question

656
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,521
of how did things start.

657
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,568
What I'm hoping you'll
pick up from all this

658
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,992
is that you don't have to
commit intellectual suicide

659
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,695
to believe in a Creator
behind the creation.

660
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,498
<i>And to the extent that
you don't allow for God,</i>

661
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,800
you'd be pretty hard-pressed
to find an incredible

662
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:35,638
alternative explanation
for how things came to be.

663
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:44,381
<i>Well, I imagine you're
quite pleased with yourself.</i>

664
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,961
I see you've carefully avoided
the fact that Stephen Hawking,

665
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,696
the world's most
famous scientist,

666
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,687
and who is not a theist,

667
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:56,125
has recently come out in favor
of a self-designing universe.

668
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:57,972
I haven't avoided
it, I just didn't...

669
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,162
You just didn't know about it.

670
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,899
<i>Alright, well let's see
what Professor Hawking,</i>

671
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,167
Lucasian Professor of
physics at Cambridge,

672
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,738
who occupies a teaching chair
once held by Sir Isaac Newton,

673
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,574
has to say about the
origin of the universe.

674
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,845
<i>And I quote, "Because
there's a law such as gravity,</i>

675
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,049
"the universe can and will
create itself from nothing.

676
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,084
"Spontaneous
creation is the reason

677
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,621
<i>"there is something
instead of nothing.</i>

678
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,557
<i>"It's why the universe
exists, why we exist.</i>

679
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,026
"It is not necessary
to invoke God

680
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,763
to set the universe in motion."

681
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,532
End of quote.

682
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,200
So, you may have never
come across his comment,

683
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,872
<i>but his point remains.</i>

684
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,842
How do you answer?

685
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,983
I don't know.

686
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,218
<i>You don't know?</i>

687
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,155
<i>I prick the balloon of
your entire argument</i>

688
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:04,126
with a single pin,
and you don't know?

689
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,128
Huh.

690
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,832
Well, I mean, I'd like to tell
you I have the perfect answer,

691
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,101
but it doesn't shake
my underlying faith.

692
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:16,973
<i>Okay, so the greatest scientific
mind in all of history says</i>

693
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,142
that God is not necessary, but
a first-semester freshman says,

694
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,513
<i>"Oh, yes he is."</i>

695
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:29,953
Wow, you know, that's
gonna be a really tough choice.

696
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,556
Well, I look forward
to next week's lecture.

697
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,058
Class is dismissed.

698
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,283
Do you think you're
smarter than me, Wheaton?

699
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,151
Do you think there's any
argument you can make

700
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,287
that I won't have an answer for?

701
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,844
I never said I was smarter.

702
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,747
That's the first intelligent
thing you've said.

703
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,127
Now, I want to make this clear.

704
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,262
In that classroom,
there is a god,

705
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,988
and yep, I'm him.

706
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,524
I'm also a jealous god, so
do not try to humiliate me

707
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,659
in front of my students.

708
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,839
You know, I also checked
up on your declared major.

709
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,229
Pre-law?

710
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:14,998
What exactly is pre-law?

711
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,844
We don't award degrees in that.

712
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,870
Don't bother
answering, but know this,

713
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,106
if you truly feel a need to
continue with the charade,

714
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,577
I will make it my personal
mission to destroy any hope

715
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,648
of a law degree in your future.

716
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,717
Have a nice day.

717
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,575
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

718
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,220
You know what I'm talking about.

719
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,056
You went and did your
argument, didn't you?

720
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,913
Yeah, yeah I did.

721
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,793
What were you trying to prove?

722
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,662
I'm not even sure there
are words to describe

723
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,052
what I'm feeling right now.

724
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,890
<i>I'm sorry Josh, but
it's over between us.</i>

725
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,125
That's it? It's
just... it's over?

726
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,405
<i>It's over, Josh.</i>

727
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,641
If you're going to do
something this stupid and selfish

728
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,142
after I already told you
what would happen...

729
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,602
Yeah, but that's sort
of the point, isn't it?

730
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,737
This is something that's
important to me, right,

731
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:29,306
but since it's not
important to you,

732
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,709
you made it a make-it-
or-break-it-thing for us.

733
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:35,377
You didn't ask me, you told me.

734
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,213
It wasn't a decision
that we made,

735
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,916
<i>it was a decision that you
made for the both of us.</i>

736
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:42,952
Well, somebody had to.

737
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:46,789
Okay.

738
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,058
That's it? "Okay"?

739
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,960
<i>It's not what I want.</i>

740
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,730
Honestly, I'm still hoping
you'll change your mind, right,

741
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,364
but I have to do this thing.

742
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,767
<i>I feel like it's something
that God wants me to do.</i>

743
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:00,803
<i>I can't just turn away
from it, especially not now,</i>

744
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,939
now that I've started.

745
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:06,142
My mother was
so right about you.

746
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,112
I just wish I'd had
the sense to listen.

Yes, Mr. Shelley.

772
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,863
I have some news.

773
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:42,364
Me too.

774
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,533
Okay, but me first.

775
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:48,171
I've just been named partner.

776
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:55,178
I think I have cancer.

777
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,820
Did you hear me?

778
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,588
<i>Did you hear what I just said?</i>

779
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,125
I have cancer.

780
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,129
This couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

781
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:14,997
What?

782
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:20,502
How can you say that to me?

783
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,306
I thought you loved me.

784
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:28,077
I do, but you're
changing our agreement,

785
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,946
you're breaking our deal.

786
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:32,634
You make it sound like
a contract negotiation.

787
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:34,283
Well, what did
you think this was?

788
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,018
I thought it was love.

789
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,087
Grow up, Amy.

790
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:42,225
<i>Love is the most overused
word in the English language.</i>

791
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:44,861
It's what we say when
we want something,

792
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,362
when we need something,

793
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,032
and you're as guilty
of it as anybody.

794
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,973
We had fun.

795
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:59,641
<i>You were my hot, young
girlfriend with the chic job.</i>

796
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:05,147
<i>I was your upwardly mobile,
charming, successful boyfriend.</i>

797
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,417
<i>And we were together
because we each got something</i>

798
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:11,420
out of the relationship
that we wanted,

799
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,322
<i>and it was good.</i>

800
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,225
It was... actually,
it was great.

801
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:20,897
But now it's over.

802
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,267
How did I not see this in you?

803
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:27,603
Because you saw what you wanted.

804
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,507
You understand that I might die?

805
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,911
And I'm sorry about that.

806
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:02,704
Hey, you're in my
philosophy class.

807
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,473
Martin, right?

808
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:07,944
Correct, and you're Mr. Josh.

809
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,478
Yeah.

810
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:14,016
Yeah, that's me, Mr. Josh.

811
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,684
Hey, is that on
our reading list?

812
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:18,287
No.

813
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,227
Can I ask you a question?

814
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,097
Yeah, sure.

815
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:33,202
Why are you doing
what you are doing?

816
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,451
Everyone else thinks I'm crazy.

817
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,509
My girlfriend...
Ex-girlfriend left me over it.

818
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:43,079
My parents don't
want me to risk it.

819
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,580
At the end of it all,

820
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,427
I'm gonna have
to work like a dog

821
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,984
for the rest of the semester

822
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,431
just to catch up on
my other classes.

823
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:53,155
You have described
your difficulties,

824
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:59,161
but you haven't answered
my question of why.

825
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,662
I don't know.

826
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,766
I just... I think of
Jesus as my friend.

827
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:09,305
<i>So, you think Jesus is God?</i>

828
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,640
Yeah, and the Son of God.

829
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,487
I don't want to disappoint him,

830
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,013
even if everyone
thinks I should.

831
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:21,250
See, to me, he's not dead.

832
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:24,420
He's alive.

833
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,988
I don't want anyone to get
talked out of believing in him

834
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:31,627
just because some
professor thinks they should.

835
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,301
See you around, Martin.

836
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,803
Bye.

837
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,053
Hiya, Tom Blanchard,
Metro City Auto.

838
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,554
<i>Here's your keys.</i>

839
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,257
- Thank you.
- Satisfaction is guaranteed.

840
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,492
Do I need to sign something?

841
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,328
Absolutely. I'm
giving you a car.

842
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,164
Sign here,

843
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,733
<i>and then one more right
there, and one more there.</i>

844
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,404
<i>And if you could just initial
there, there, and there.</i>

845
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,106
Thank you.

846
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:19,395
Call us when you're back.
You have it for the weekend.

847
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:20,776
We'll come pick you up.

848
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:22,644
Thanks.

849
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,221
You're kidding.

850
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,737
What did you do?
Did you break it?

851
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,295
What?

852
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:41,664
Check and see
if it's still in gear.

853
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,265
No, it's in park.

854
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,602
I don't understand. It
worked 5 minutes ago.

855
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,106
Alright, well, now it's not.

856
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,707
How soon can you
get us another car?

857
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,554
<i>Well, not tonight.</i>

858
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,177
<i>It's already after 5:30.</i>

859
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:56,678
Everyone's gone home

860
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:01,150
and I'm already kind
of late for an audition.

861
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:02,651
An audition?

862
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,188
Yeah, the gang and I are
doing "Death of a Salesman"

863
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:10,292
<i>and it's kind of a
dinner theatre thing.</i>

864
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,694
What happened to
satisfaction guaranteed?

865
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,897
It's alright, David. We
can leave tomorrow.

866
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,467
You want to make this
drive and miss half the day?

867
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,503
Perhaps it's gonna rain anyway.

868
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:24,706
Forecast for tomorrow
is 82 and sunny at 9 a.m.

869
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,742
Sometimes you
don't make any sense.

870
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,910
Sometimes you make too much.

871
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,348
Just remember, God is good.

872
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:33,849
All the time.

873
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:35,551
And all the time?

874
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,320
God is good.

875
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,757
Will you sign this
saying you reject the car?

876
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,578
You're on with Marc.

877
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,226
It's me, dork, your sister.

878
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,249
<i>Oh, and this is about?</i>

879
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,895
You really should go see Mom.

880
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,452
She's not doing well.

881
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:12,061
She hasn't been
doing well for years.

882
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:13,656
That's why they
call it dementia.

883
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,370
<i>Still, you should go see her.</i>

884
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,437
Claire said you haven't
been there in awhile.

885
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,794
<i>Like it matters?</i>

886
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,198
Besides, I just
bought her a new TV.

887
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,799
Look, I'll make you a deal.

888
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,202
You go and you ask
her what 3 + 3 equals.

889
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,804
If she gives you the
right answer, I'll visit.

890
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,506
That's not fair.

891
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,208
<i>Life's not fair. I gotta go.</i>

892
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,709
Say hi to Amy.

893
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,411
<i>No, that's over.</i>

894
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,912
What'd you do?

895
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:38,780
Unresolved personal issues.

896
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,217
She's got some stuff
she's gotta work through.

897
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,818
I'm sorry to hear that.

898
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,287
Well, that's the way it goes.

899
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,956
Okay, ready to get this started?

900
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,439
Seriously, you
have got to get a life.

901
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:05,974
Yeah, tell me about it.

902
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,480
Hey honey.

903
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,460
<i>Oh, sorry, the door was open.</i>

904
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:15,451
I just let myself in.

905
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,319
- Hi.
- Hi.

906
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:23,024
Oh hey, did you pick up
the bottle of wine I wanted?

907
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,962
I did.

908
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,366
I left it in the car.

909
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,867
It's in the car.

910
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,736
Don't worry about it.

911
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,582
You have a lot on your plate.

912
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,938
So, you know, just...

913
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,709
Thank you for helping
set up our dinner party.

914
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:43,812
Well, unless I'm wrong,

915
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,941
all the guests are from
the philosophy department?

916
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,385
That's not true.
Vivian's a sociologist.

917
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,852
You're proving my point.

918
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,921
Look, I can't help it.

919
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,392
See, my intellectual
rigor falls to pieces

920
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,572
the instant I get around you.

921
00:54:58,596 --> 00:54:59,928
Really?

922
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:01,664
You could have fooled me.

923
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,300
The first time I walked
into your classroom,

924
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,303
you were all blood and thunder.

925
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:13,309
That was a performance,
staged largely for your benefit.

926
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:18,547
In the mean time, I kept
trying to keep my eyes off you

927
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,650
and hoping that there was a
brain inside that pretty head.

928
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,352
<i>Why?</i>

929
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,087
Well, because if there
wasn't, then, you know,

930
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:30,426
there's no way I could have
made myself go out with you.

931
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,796
Look, as it was, I waited
until you aced the midterm.

932
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,497
It was an A-minus.

933
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,066
Close enough.

934
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,674
Come on, where is she?

935
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,376
Huh?

936
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:48,877
Who?

937
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,024
That carefree,
free-spirited girl

938
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:57,486
who forced me to almost
risk my career by dating her.

939
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:00,166
You know, the one who quoted
Emily Dickinson, and Shelley,

940
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,124
and Spongebob Squarepants
with equal self-confidence.

941
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:06,829
I mean, what ever
happened to the old Mina?

942
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:10,366
'Cause I miss her.

943
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,669
She has got a mom who's failing,

944
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:16,872
she's sensing
time is passing by,

945
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,812
and she's starting to wonder
if she's unequally yoked.

946
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:28,417
Alright, you've been
reading again, haven't you?

947
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:33,722
Reading, listening, thinking.

948
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,702
You can hardly
call this thinking.

949
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,528
As a matter of fact, it's
the opposite of thinking.

950
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,864
You know I'm a Christian.

951
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:43,872
<i>You knew that when you
first started seeing me.</i>

952
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,869
Yes, and you know that I'm not.

953
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,570
Yeah, I know,

954
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,071
and I know there's
a lot of things

955
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,774
you don't want to talk about,

956
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,475
so we don't talk about them.

957
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:57,513
Yeah, except the not
talking is starting to get louder

958
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,959
and louder, and soon
it will be deafening,

959
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:05,587
and I don't know if I
can put up with that.

960
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,825
- I know.
- Do you?
- Yeah.

961
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,494
Because we need
to be clear on this.

962
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,897
There's only room in
this relationship for two,

963
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,185
which means I
don't get a mistress

964
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:19,780
and you don't get to drag a
2,000-year-old dead carpenter

965
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:22,671
turned itinerant
rabbi into our lives.

966
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,707
Look, I'm gonna go freshen up.

967
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,522
Is this the same car?

968
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,268
Oh, no sir. No, sir.

969
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,070
Same model, different color.

970
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,772
The other one was a cabernet.

971
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,465
<i>This is more of a merlot.</i>

972
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,533
<i>You know, lying's not good.</i>

973
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,470
<i>Lying to an ordained
minister is flat-out bad.</i>

974
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,971
You know that, right?

975
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,819
<i>Sir, I assure you this is
a different automobile.</i>

976
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:01,209
<i>Here, try it out.</i>

977
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:06,147
How'd your audition go?

978
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,850
Oh, pretty good.

979
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:13,021
I'm up for the role of Biff,
so... thanks for asking.

980
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:35,143
You guys going somewhere?

981
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,592
How's it look for you with
the department chair position?

982
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:40,760
I'm up for review mid-semester.

983
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:42,929
Dean Powell assures
me it's a slam dunk.

984
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,899
<i>Well, congratulations Jeffrey.</i>

985
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:48,991
Anything else on your plate?

986
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,059
Not really.

987
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:55,964
<i>Feel like sharing?</i>

988
00:58:56,133 --> 00:59:00,802
I've got this student in my
introductory class this semester

989
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,572
who's... well, he's
taken a challenge

990
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,542
to prove the existence of God.

991
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,043
In your classroom?

992
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,013
- Yes.
- Silly boy.

993
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,248
- Freshman?
- Oh yeah.

994
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:15,695
Doesn't seem quite fair to me.

995
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,052
Well, how's that?

996
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,166
<i>He's inexperienced
in front of a room,</i>

997
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,935
and you're expecting
him to compete with you

998
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,103
<i>in your own field of expertise.</i>

999
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,272
<i>Come on, Mina.
This is fun for me.</i>

1000
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,207
I can't help it if a boy wants
to make a fool of himself

1001
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,165
and commit academic suicide.

1002
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,867
<i>Look, I tried to stop him.</i>

1003
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,880
I gave him an
out, but no, no, no,

1004
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:36,572
he wants to prove
that God isn't dead.

1005
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:42,711
Look, I know I am
in the minority here,

1006
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,681
but I actually believe in God.

1007
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:54,856
Yes, yes, well, she is...
She's a work in progress.

1008
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,773
<i>So, darling, I think it's best
we just change the subject.</i>

1009
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,074
<i>But I'm just saying...</i>

1010
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,700
Mina, I've asked politely, okay?

1011
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,269
Okay.

1012
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,918
The coq au vin is almost done.

1013
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,709
<i>Excellent.</i>

1014
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,644
To the dining room.

1015
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:57,211
<i>Nothing like a nice
merlot to take the edge off.</i>

1016
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,357
Cheers, everyone.

1017
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,328
Mina, this wine is awful.

1018
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,031
It's been cooked.

1019
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,067
It tastes like it was sunning
in a moldy basement.

1020
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,115
Talk about your
"Grapes of Wrath."

1021
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,844
I bought it before I went
shopping the other day.

1022
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,914
I locked it in the trunk

1023
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,850
and when I got
home I forgot about it.

1024
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:32,420
Well, I think this dinner
serves as a valuable lesson.

1025
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,090
<i>As Socrates put it
over 2,000 years ago,</i>

1026
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,060
"Gnothi seauton."

1027
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:43,364
Looks like it's Greek to her.

1028
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,702
<i>Oh, it's "Know thyself,"
darling, know thyself.</i>

1029
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,107
Which I suggest means
knowing your own limitations.

1030
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:05,020
You know, if you'll
all excuse me,

1031
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:08,123
it's time for the
help to depart.

1032
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,158
Sweetheart...

1033
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:20,362

1034
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:35,377

<i>that I couldn't answer.</i>

1044
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,921
<i>As Professor
Radisson pointed out,</i>

1045
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,023
<i>Stephen Hawking is an atheist.</i>

1046
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,036
<i>He also wrote a book
called "The Grand Design"</i>

1047
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:21,562
<i>in which he says the following:</i>

1048
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:24,032
<i>"Because there is a
law such as gravity,</i>

1049
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:28,503
<i>the universe can and will
create itself from nothing."</i>

1050
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:32,274
And to be honest, I didn't
know how to refute that.

1051
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:39,281
I mean, after all, Hawking
is clearly a genius.

1052
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:42,017
But, Professor John Lennox,

1053
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:43,863
who teaches mathematics
and philosophy

1054
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,487
<i>has demonstrated that
there are not one, even two,</i>

1055
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,990
but three errors
of logic contained

1056
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,525
<i>in that one simple sentence,</i>

1057
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:54,395
and it all boils down
to circular reasoning.

1058
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,232
<i>Hawking is basically saying
that the universe exists</i>

1059
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,534
<i>because the universe
needed to exist,</i>

1060
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,380
and because the
universe needed to exist,

1061
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,306
it therefore created itself.

1062
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,007
<i>It's like this.</i>

1063
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,021
If I say to you that I can prove

1064
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,123
that Spam is the best-tasting
food that's ever existed

1065
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:13,448
because in all of history, no
food has ever tasted better,

1066
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,295
you'd probably
look at me strange

1067
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:16,996
and say I haven't
proven anything.

1068
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,353
And you'd be right,

1069
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,621
all I've done is restate
my original claim.

1070
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,969
<i>But when Hawking claims
that the universe created itself</i>

1071
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:25,126
<i>because it needed
to create itself,</i>

1072
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,255
and then offers that
as an explanation

1073
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,397
as to how and
why it was created,

1074
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:32,901
we don't immediately recognize
that he's doing the same thing.

1075
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:36,204
But he is, prompting
Lennox to further comment,

1076
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,939
<i>"Nonsense remains nonsense,</i>

1077
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,876

01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,555

1080
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:45,881
This is the height of hubris.

1081
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,526
<i>Are you telling me
that you, a freshman,</i>

1082
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,450
are saying that Stephen
Hawking is wrong?

1083
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,921
No, what I'm saying
is that John Lennox,

1084
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,050
<i>a professor of
mathematics and philosophy,</i>

1085
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,203
<i>has found Professor
Hawking's reasoning to be faulty,</i>

1086
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,393
and I agree with his logic.

1087
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,129
<i>But if you can't
bear to disagree</i>

1088
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:02,630
with Hawking's thinking,

1089
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,200
then I suggest that you
turn to page five of his book,

1090
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:09,237
where he insists
philosophy is dead.

1091
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,639
<i>And if you're so sure</i>

1092
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:13,486
of Professor
Hawking's infallibility,

1093
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,188
and philosophy really is dead,

1094
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:21,082
then well, there's really
no need for this class.

1095
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:28,423
<i>It's like I'm a
convenience to him,</i>

1096
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,226
<i>except for when
my faith comes up,</i>

1097
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,506
then he becomes
verbally abusive.

1098
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,563
I'm guessing he's bright.

1099
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,265
Brilliant.

1100
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,034
Handsome.

1101
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:40,535
Yes.

1102
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,271
And his attention
makes you feel special,

1103
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,673
gives you a sense
of completeness.

1104
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,443
Have you been reading my diary?

1105
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,046
Psychologists call it
the Cinderella complex.

1106
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:54,015
It's not my name for it,
so don't get upset with me.

1107
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55,544
Guys are capable
of the same thing.

1108
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,618
It's just they don't
have a name for it.

1109
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,532
But in essence, you're
looking for his approval

1110
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,056
to give you a
sense of self-worth

1111
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:03,258
instead of generating
it internally.

1112
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:05,126
Don't most people do that?

1113
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,595
Yeah, a lot of people do, sure.

1114
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:09,464
But, using romance
to shore up self-image

1115
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,367
is an unstable foundation.

1116
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:15,736
Do you believe God's capable
of error, bias, or bad judgment?

1117
01:06:16,106 --> 01:06:17,439
No.

1118
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,375
So, if he's incapable
of mistakes,

1119
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,545
and he made you in
his likeness and image,

1120
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:27,315
then it follows that he
cares about you, right?

1121
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,250
Right.

1122
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,986
To the point where
God's only Son

1123
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:35,457
would willingly be crucified
again for you, just you,

1124
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,492
if that's what was necessary.

1125
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,261
Well, if he loves you that much,

1126
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:44,665
who cares what
your boyfriend thinks?

1127
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:50,571
To the wrong person,
you'll never have any worth.

1128
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:57,512
But to the right person,
you'll mean everything.

1129
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:04,386
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,</i>

1130
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:07,622
for the last 150 years,
Darwinists have been saying

1131
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,492
that God is unnecessary
to explain man's existence

1132
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,161
<i>and that evolution replaces God,</i>

1133
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,375
<i>but evolution only
tells you what happens</i>

1134
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:17,165
<i>once you have life.</i>

1135
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,612
<i>So, where did that something
that's alive come from?</i>

1136
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:21,702
Well, Darwin never
really addressed it.

1137
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,205
He assumed maybe some
lightning hit a stagnant pool

1138
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,851
full of the right
kind of chemicals

1139
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,410
and bingo, a living something.

1140
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:31,146
But it's just not that simple.

1141
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:34,382
<i>You see, Darwin claimed that
the ancestry of all living things</i>

1142
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,718
<i>came from that one
single, simple organism</i>

1143
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,355
which reproduced and was
slowly modified over time

1144
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,657
<i>into the complex life
forms we view today.</i>

1145
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,626
Which is why, after
contemplating his own theory,

1146
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:48,263
Darwin uttered his
famous statement,

1147
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,231
"Natura non facit saltum,"

1148
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,603
<i>meaning, "Nature does not jump."</i>

1149
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,972
<i>Well, as noted author
Lee Strobel pointed out,</i>

1150
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:01,176
that if you can picture
the entire 3.8 billion years

1151
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:03,464
<i>that scientists say
life has been around</i>

1152
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:05,113
<i>as one 24-hour day,</i>

1153
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:07,648
<i>in the space of just
about 90 seconds,</i>

1154
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,817
<i>most major animal
groups suddenly appear</i>

1155
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:11,664
<i>in the forms in which
they currently hold.</i>

1156
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:14,155
<i>Not slowly and steadily
as Darwin predicted,</i>

1157
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:18,659
but in evolutionary
terms, almost instantly.

1158
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,829
So, "nature does
not jump" becomes

1159
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:25,766
<i>"nature makes a giant leap."</i>

1160
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,169
<i>So, how do theists
explain this sudden outburst</i>

1161
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,638
of new biological information?

1162
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,508
"And God said, 'Let the
water teem with living creatures

1163
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,354
<i>"'and let birds fly
above the earth</i>

1164
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:37,156
<i>across the expanse of the sky.'</i>

1165
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,824
<i>"So God created the
great creatures of the sea</i>

1166
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,526
<i>"and every living
and moving thing</i>

1167
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,261
<i>"with which the water teems,</i>

1168
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,618
"according to its kind.

1169
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:49,690
And God saw that it
was good," Genesis 1:20.

1170
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,637
In other words,
creation happened

1171
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,541
because God said
it should happen.

1172
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:55,357

letting you speak in

But today, we're gonna

1291
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:50,244
<i>Evil.</i>

1292
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:54,982
<i>Now, it's been said that evil is
atheism's most potent weapon</i>

1293
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:57,351
against the Christian
faith, and it is.

1294
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,354
<i>After all, the very existence
of evil begs the question,</i>

1295
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:04,591
<i>"If God is all-good
and God is all-powerful,</i>

1296
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:08,095
why does he
allow evil to exist?"

1297
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:15,870
The answer at its core is
remarkably simple: free will.

1298
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:18,472
<i>God allows evil to exist
because of free will.</i>

1299
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,275
<i>From the Christian standpoint,
God tolerates evil in this world</i>

1300
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,143
on a temporary
basis so that one day,

1301
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,346
those who choose
to love him freely

1302
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:27,994
will dwell with him in heaven,
free from the influence of evil,

1303
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,617
but with their
free will in tact.

1304
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:36,023
<i>In other words, God's
intention concerning evil</i>

1305
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,892
is to one day destroy it.

1306
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,580
<i>Well, how convenient.</i>

1307
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:44,431
"One day, I will get rid
of all the evil in the world.

1308
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,567
"But until then, you just
have to deal with all the wars,

1309
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:51,471
<i>"and Holocausts, tsunamis,
poverty, starvation, and AIDS.</i>

1310
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,540
<i>Have a nice life."</i>

1311
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:56,476
Next, he'll be lecturing
us on moral absolutes.

1312
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,245
But why not?

1313
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,382
<i>Professor Radisson,
who's clearly an atheist,</i>

1314
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:03,083
doesn't believe
in moral absolutes,

1315
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,685
but his core syllabus says
he plans to give us an exam

1316
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,388
during finals week.

1317
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,556
Now, I'm betting that if
I manage to get an "A"

1318
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:11,258
on the exam by cheating,

1319
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,105
he'll suddenly start
sounding like a Christian,

1320
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,461
<i>insisting it's wrong to cheat,</i>

1321
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,163
<i>that I should have known that.</i>

1322
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,999
<i>And yet, what
basis does he have?</i>

1323
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:22,102
If my actions are calculated
to help me succeed,

1324
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,238
then why shouldn't
I perform them?

1325
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:27,641
For Christians, the
fixed point of morality,

1326
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,543
what constitutes
right and wrong,

1327
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:33,480
is a straight line that
leads directly back to God.

1328
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:36,694
<i>Oh, so you're saying that
we need a God to be moral,</i>

1329
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,278
that a moral atheist
is an impossibility.

1330
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,956
<i>No, but with no God, there's
no real reason to be moral.</i>

1331
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:43,484
I mean, there's
not even a standard

1332
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,225
of what moral behavior is.

1333
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:48,262
For Christians, lying,
cheating, stealing...

1334
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,311
<i>In my example, stealing
a grade I didn't earn...</i>

1335
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:51,966
<i>Are forbidden.</i>

1336
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:53,467
<i>It's a form of theft.</i>

1337
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,169
But if God does not exist,

1338
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:57,704
as Dostoyevsky
famously pointed out,

1339
01:22:58,074 --> 01:23:05,079
<i>"If God does not exist, then
everything is permissible."</i>

1340
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:08,449
<i>And not only
permissible, but pointless.</i>

1341
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:11,085
If Professor Radisson
is right, then all of this,

1342
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:15,389
all of our struggle, our debate,

1343
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:18,459
whatever we decide
here is meaningless.

1344
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:20,307
I mean, our lives and
ultimately our deaths

1345
01:23:20,463 --> 01:23:22,596
have no more consequence
than that of a goldfish.

1346
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,298
This is ridiculous.

1347
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:26,000
So, after all your talk,

1348
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,246
you're saying that it all
comes down to choice:

1349
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,603
believe or don't believe.

1350
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,439
That's right,
that's all there is.

1351
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:34,141
That's all there's ever been.

1352
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,154
The only difference between
your position and my position

1353
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,379
is that you take
away their choice.

1354
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:41,448
You demand that they choose
the box marked, "I don't believe."

1355
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:44,229
<i>Yes, because I
want to free them.</i>

1356
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:45,830
Because religion is like a...

1357
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,756
<i>It's like a mind virus that
parents have passed on</i>

1358
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:51,658
down to their children,

1359
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:53,987
and Christianity is
the worst virus of all.

1360
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,607
It slowly creeps into our lives

1361
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:58,032
when we're weak
or sick or helpless.

1362
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,533
So, religion is like a disease?

1363
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,381
<i>Yes. Yes, it infects everything.</i>

1364
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:04,171
It's the enemy of reason.

1365
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,672
Reason?

1366
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:07,519
Professor, you left
reason a long time ago.

1367
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,276
What you're teaching
here isn't philosophy.

1368
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:11,045
It's not even atheism anymore.

1369
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:13,180
What you're
teaching is antitheism.

1370
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:15,049
It's not enough that
you don't believe.

1371
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,752
You need all of us to
not believe with you.

1372
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:20,798
<i>Why don't you admit the truth?</i>

1373
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,323
You just want to ensnare them
in your primitive superstition.

1374
01:24:23,492 --> 01:24:25,492
What I want is for them
to make their own choice.

01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,508
You have no idea how much
I'm gonna enjoy failing you.

1377
01:24:29,532 --> 01:24:31,765
Yeah, but who are you really
looking to fail, Professor?

1378
01:24:32,134 --> 01:24:36,270
Me or God?

1379
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,114
Do you hate God?

1380
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:48,760
That's not even a question.

1381
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:51,751
Okay, why do you hate God?

1382
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,454
This is ridiculous.

1383
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:56,190
Why do you hate God?
Answer the question.

1384
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:57,869
<i>You've seen the science
and the arguments.</i>

1385
01:24:57,893 --> 01:24:59,426
<i>Science supports his existence.</i>

1386
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,761
You know the truth.

1387
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,663
So, why do you hate him?

1388
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,366
Why?!

1389
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:08,402
It's a very simple
question, Professor.

1390
01:25:08,571 --> 01:25:11,171
<i>Why do you hate God?</i>

1391
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:14,575
Because he took
everything away from me.

1392
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:17,677
Yes, I hate God.

1393
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:21,715
All I have for him is hate.

1394
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:32,759
How can you hate
someone if they don't exist?

1395
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:44,471
You've proven nothing.

1396
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,706
Maybe not.

1397
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:52,712
They get to choose.

1398
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:03,223
Is God dead?

1399
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:28,682
God is not dead.

1400
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,385
God's not dead.

1401
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:32,964
God's not dead. God's not dead.

1402
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:35,634
God's not dead. God's
not dead. God's not dead.

Your decision to

1419

please allow this car to start.

1421

1423
01:28:12,688 --> 01:28:15,656
Why, do you have a better

1425
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:19,959
No.

1426
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:24,331
So then, let's give it a try.

1427
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,733
Okay.

1428
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,435
No, no, no, no.

1429
01:28:28,604 --> 01:28:32,406
Put our bags in the trunk first.

1430
01:28:32,574 --> 01:28:37,678
David, we spend our entire
lives talking about faith.

1431
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:41,815
Now I'm asking
you to show faith.

1432
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:47,387
Okay.

1433
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:06,105
- Unbelievable.
- No. Faith.

1434
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,413
- God is good.
- All the time.

1435
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:18,017
- And all the time?
- God is good.

1436
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:35,635
I don't even know

1437
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:40,607
I mean, it's not like you
even know who I am.

1438
01:29:50,486 --> 01:29:56,823
<i>You prayed and believed</i>

1439
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,627
your whole life,

1440
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:05,866
never done anything wrong,

1441
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:08,935
and here you are.

1442
01:30:09,104 --> 01:30:15,642
<i>You're the nicest person

1443

You have dementia,

1444
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,819
Explain that to me.

1445
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,824
Sometimes the
devil allows people

1446
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:34,961
to live a life free of trouble

1447
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:41,067
'cause he doesn't want
them turning to God.

1448
01:30:41,236 --> 01:30:47,941
Your sin is like a jail cell,
except it's all nice and comfy,

1449
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:52,078
and there doesn't seem
to be any need to leave.

1450
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:57,684
The door's wide open

1451
01:30:57,853 --> 01:31:03,824
'til one day, time runs out,

1452
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:09,863
and the cell door slams shut

1453
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:16,202
and suddenly... it's too late.

1454
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,147
Who did you say you were?

1455
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:39,058
I can't believe this.

1456
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,827
The car actually starts

1457
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,630
and now we're being
done-in by believers.

1458
01:31:43,799 --> 01:31:45,198
I think it's beautiful.

1459
01:31:45,567 --> 01:31:47,111
Please, no more words of wisdom.

1460
01:31:47,135 --> 01:31:48,668
But I'm just happy to see

1461
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,517
all these people going
to sing about Jesus.

1462
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:53,006
Move!

1463
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,521
Hello, gentlemen.

1464
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,022
Can I help you?

1465
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,869
I'm Amy Ryan. I
write "The New Left."

1466
01:32:10,893 --> 01:32:12,258
Michael Tait. How are you?

1467
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:13,960
Did we schedule this?

1468
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:17,731
No, I actually find that the
best interviews are unscripted.

1469
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:20,344
<i>So, in a few minutes, you
guys are gonna go out there</i>

1470
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:23,069
<i>and you're gonna sing
about God and Jesus</i>

1471
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:25,572
as if they're as
real as you and me.

1472
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:27,306
<i>How can you do that?</i>

1473
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:30,243
Well, to us, they are as real.

1474
01:32:30,612 --> 01:32:32,546
<i>As a matter of
fact, even more so.</i>

1475
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,715
I mean, we exist
in the here and now.

1476
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,151
They've existed
forever. Think about that.

1477
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:41,220
Yeah, you know, in the
beginning was the Word.

1478
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,724
The Word was with God
and the Word was God.

1479
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,072
So, I see. So when
you're pressed,

1480
01:32:48,096 --> 01:32:49,941
you quote a bunch of
ancient scribblings and say,

1481
01:32:49,965 --> 01:32:52,243
<i>"Don't worry,
it's all in there."</i>

1482
01:32:52,267 --> 01:32:54,935
Well, they may be ancient,
but they're not scribblings.

1483
01:32:55,103 --> 01:32:58,204
I mean, we believe God
gave us an instruction manual,

1484
01:32:58,373 --> 01:33:00,213
and it's where we
draw our strength

1485
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,610
<i>and it's where we find our hope.</i>

1486
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:06,780
So, where do you find your hope?

1487
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:18,658
I'm dying.

1488
01:33:23,732 --> 01:33:28,134
<i>Hey Amy, you're not
here to trash us, are you?</i>

1489
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:30,114
<i>I think that's what
you might have done,</i>

1490
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:33,239
<i>but I think you're
here kinda wondering,</i>

1491
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:39,613
kinda hoping that this
stuff is for real, aren't you?

1492
01:33:41,049 --> 01:33:42,381
How do you know that?

1493
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:45,563
<i>I just felt that that's
what God was saying,</i>

1494
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:49,956

you to know it.

1495
